 Achroia grisella (Kundungal et al., 2019) and Spodoptera frugiperda (Zhang et al., 2022b).

Both T. molitor and T. obscurus larvae are not only two widely investigated plastic-degrading insect larvae (Wu and Cridde, 2021; Yang et al., 2023b), but also are commercially reared for animal feed and insect protein, typically being fed with wheat bran (WB) (Ding et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2021c). Our previous work has shown that both species can rapidly biodegrade LDPE, LLDPE and HDPE (Yang et al., 2021c, 2022). Studies of LDPE biodegradation by these two species have demonstrated that under nutrient-poor conditions, coordination of gut microbiome carbon and nitrogen metabolism is necessary for energy and nutrition acquisition during plastic degradation (Ding et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023a). Although T. molitor and T. obscurus have distinct behaviours (Peng et al., 2019; Robinson, 2005), both species can adapt to LDPE diets by altering their gut microbiota or microbiome structure (Dai et al., 2022; Welti et al., 2020) to ensure their capacity to survive using PE as their sole source of both energy and carbon within a 3–5 week period (Lou et al., 2020, 2021; Przemieniecki et al., 2020; Woo et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2021a, 2021b, 2021c, 2022). Previous research on reported that a decrease in gut microbial community similarity occurs after larvae switch to a plastic-based diet, such as LDPE, PS, and etc. (Brandon et al., 2018; Peng et al., 2019, 2021; Przemieniecki et al., 2020; Ruiz Barrionuevo et al., 2022a, 2022b; Yang et al., 2022, Yang et al., 2023a). However, the majority of reports on microbiomes associated with PE degradation by insect larvae have focused on LDPE (Brandon et al., 2018; Peng et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2021c).

During plastics biodegradation, Tenebrio larvae are directly exposed to PE microplastics (MPs), through biofragmentation of ingested plastic foams or particles into fragments by chewing, grinding, and digestion in the gut. Studies on other macroinvertebrates have shown that long-term exposure to MPs can cause biological toxicity, causing mechanical damage and the onset of inflammatory responses in Corbicula fluminea, mice and zebrafish (Li et al., 2021).The gut is a vital line of defence against exogenous substances, as well as being an essential organ for immunity, digestion and absorption in insects. When the gut microbiota becomes imbalanced or are mechanically stimulated, various inflammatory and immune cells are activated, leading to intestinal inflammation (Baeckhed et al., 2005; Li et al., 2021; Suzuki et al., 2004). However, the extent to which gut health reflects the effects of PE-MPs with different PCPs on Tenebrio larvae during plastic degradation, has not been clearly elucidated. Our previous studies found that different metabolic intermediates were generated when T. molitor and T. obscurus larvae ingested and digested HDPE, LLDPE and LDPE. The degradation intermediates formed may also affect on T. obscurus and T. molitor larvae.

For more than a decade, PE has been the top plastic in the world, and it is a promising sustainable technology and green strategy to utilize the mealworms, which are macroinvertebrates with the ability to degrade plastics, in the biodegradation of PE. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have comprehensively addressed the comparison of the impacts of PE type (LDPE, LLDPE and HDPE) on larval physiology, gut microbiome and oxidative stress (at a physiological or biochemical level). In addition, in the long run, the larvae degrade microplastics and then excrete plastic into the ecosystem, and it is important to investigate whether their frass contain toxic substances that are harmful to aquatic and terrestrial organisms in

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Sources of Tenebrio larvae

T. molitor larvae were procured from the Dafa Birds and Flower Market in Harbin, China while T. obscurus larvae were procured from a Breeding Farm in Zaozhuang, Shandong, China. The dealers claimed that the larvae were fed a diet without antibiotics.

2.2. PE materials

The high-purity PE powders (size: <300 μm) of LDPE, HDPE, and LLDPE were purchased from Shanghai Plastics Trading Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China. The molecular weights are Mn 42.2, 93.2, and 59.5 kDa; Mw 110.5, 222.5, and 182 kDa; and size averaged molecular weight (Mz) 216.1, 456.5, and 408.8 kDa for LDPE, LLDPE, and HDPE, respectively (Table S1).

 \({ }^{\circledR}\) solution at pH 3.5 in a magnetic stirrer for 10-15 min. The polystyrene was then dried in absorbent paper and incubated overnight at \(59{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) to remove all remaining humidity and carefully observed under a stereomicroscope to confirm the absence of organic materials (e.g. exuviae). Undegraded substrate, ideally composed of not eaten PS debris and fecal pellets, was sieved to separate the two components. The resulting PS fraction was weighted and added to the above figure.

\subsection*{2.3. DNA extraction of gut microorganisms, markers amplification and sequencing}

At the end of the experiment, total DNA was extracted from A. diaperinus guts to characterize its microbial communities. Lesser mealworm larvae were collected and the whole intestines dissected under a Leica Wild M3C stereomicroscope using Petri dishes filled with sterilized paraffin as support. Total DNA was extracted using the QIAamp PowerFecal \({ }^{\circledR}\) DNA Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Extractions were made in triplicates from each group, i.e. three individual larvae were used to have triplicate observations from the PS group and three from the control group. DNA extractions were used for a metabarcoding analysis of the fungal and bacterial communities using the ITS1 and the 16S v3-v4 region as molecular marker, respectively (details in Protocol S1; Supplementary material).

\subsection*{2.4. Data analysis}

Raw sequences were demultiplexed based on their indices and primer sequences were removed. Quality trimming/filtering was performed in trimmomatic v.0.39 (Bolger et al., 2014) and then processed using the Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology v.2 software (QIIME2 - v.2019.7) (Bolyen et al., 2019) as described in Protocol S2 (Supplementary material).

Diversity analyses were performed in QIIME2 and data for both markers were rarefied at the minimum sampling depth observed among samples prior to analyses. Good's coverage, Simpson and Shannon diversity indices ( \(\alpha\) diversity), were calculated for both markers, using the Kruskal-Wallis test to compare values across groups. Bray-Curtis Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) was performed on both datasets. The phylogeny-based Unifrac distances (weighted and unweighted) PCoA were applied to the bacteria dataset only ( \(\beta\) diversity). QIME2 workflows are provided as Protocol S3 (bacteria) and Protocol S4 (fungi) (Supplementary material).

Differential abundance of OTUs was evaluated for both datasets (on the original non rarefied datasets) using the Phyloseq and DESeq2 packages in R v.3.6.1 (R Core Team 2018, http://www.R-project.org/) (Love et al., 2014; McMurdie and Holmes, 2013), and OTUs with an associated adjusted \(p\)-value (padj) \(<0.05\) were retained. The custom R script for this procedure is supplied as Protocol S5 of Supplementary material.

\section*{3. Results}

\subsection*{3.1. A. diaperinus survival rate and polystyrene weight loss}

Alphitobius diaperinus underwent a reduction of 77\% and 89\% of total weight in the CT and PS group, respectively. Reduction was more severe in the PS compared to the CT group (1.2×).

The weight of the polystyrene decreased during the experiment from 20 g (time zero) to 16 g (day 30) \((s=2.83)\). Henceforth, 4 g (20\%) of polystyrene was presumably degraded during 30 days of incubation.

\subsection*{3.2. Diversity of bacteria}



The taxa bar plot showed the presence of six predominant bacterial phyla, mostly with different relative frequencies: Proteobacteria (76% and 57% in PS and CT, respectively), Bacteroidetes (3% and 26%), Firmicutes (13% and 8%), Actinobacteria (4% and 8%), Fusobacteria (3% and \(<1 \%)\) and an unassigned phylum (<1% in both groups) (Fig. 1a).

Clustering at the level of classes identified eight predominant entities, often represented with different relative frequencies: Gammaproteobacteria (76% and 57%), Bacteroidia (3% and 25%), Bacilli (13% and 7%), Actinobacteria (4% and 8%), Fusobacteria (3% and 1%), Alphaproteobacteria (<1% and 1%), Erysipelotrichia (<1% both) and an unassigned class (<1% both) (Fig. 1b).

Shared OTUs count indicated that \(\sim 30 \%\) OTUs were shared among treatment and control groups, \(\sim 50 \%\) were observed in control only and \(\sim 20 \%\) in treatment only (Fig. 2).

The Good's coverage index, an estimate of the representativeness of the data, produced values higher than 0.99 for both PS and CT groups, thus indicating that the sequencing depth could be considered appropriate to provide an adequate estimation of the bacterial diversity in the samples. The Shannon and Simpson indices (Table 1) produced high values overall, with the only exception of one PS sample (library PS3). Based on the Simpson

| Number of eggs | 46.5±2.77a | 28.9±1.90c | 31.80±2.45d |

(a, b, c) Mean values with different superscripts within the same row differ significantly (p<0.05)

Regarding the low number of eggs produced by mealworms fed PS foam, it seems a logical consequence of the low rate of growth and development of larvae, pupae and imago itself. As reported by Young-Kyu Park and colleagues, it was revealed that fecundity of T. molitor was significantly affected by the pupal weight (Park et al., 2012) and might also related to the adult weight (Morales-Ramos et al., 2012).

Another thing that is not less important revealed in this study is that XPS foam provides less productivity measures compared to EPS foam feeds. This may be related to the physical and chemical aspects differences between EPS foam and XPS. EPS foam known to have a higher rate of permeability, contains up to 15% recycled content, has never contained HFCs, CFCs, HCFCs, formaldehyde, or color dyes (ACH, 2013). HFCCs, as one example, was known to not only reduce body weight but also cause microscopic liver lesions in laboratory mammals (WHO, 2000). Formaldehyde is another chemical content in XPS foam that is allegedly responsible for low productivity in mealworms. Formaldehyde solution is known to be common strategy used to control microbial growth in many insect diets and effectively caused decrease in the microbial development (Roeder et al., 2010).

Although PS foam feed proved unable to match the productivity effects of standard diets on the growth, development and reproduction of T. molitor beetle but the use of mealworms for the purpose of polystyrene waste biodegradation, especially when combined with other biodegradation techniques, is quite promising. There are many laboratory and field tests indicate that some soil microbes able to degrade PS foam to an adequate level. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Aspergillus niger are examples among soil inhabitants bacteria proven to decrease various types of plastic waste including PS foam (Asmita et al., 2015). Other soil microbes that are also worth considering to be combined with the use of mealworms in PS waste biodegradation are fungi. Rhizopus oryzae, Aspergillus terreus and Phanerochaete chrysosporium are examples of soil inhabitants fungi that were able to colonize polystyrene film surface for a quite period of time without any other carbon source (Atiq, 2011).

\section*{Conclusion}

The findings of this study show that PS foam does not have a lethal effect on the mealworms, but is clearly can not equate, moreover to surpass, the productivity effects of standard diets especially yeasts. It is inferred that the PS foam is not worthy feasible to be used as economical feeds in mealworms cultivation. Mealworms fed with PS foam feeds showed a low rate of growth and development of larvae, pupae and imago and make the imago produce a lower number of eggs. Between the two types of PS waste, XPS foam provides less productivity measures compared to EPS foam feeds. However, given that PS foam feeds can maintain the insects life and produce eggs, the use of mealworms in PS waste degradation is still worth considering.

 0.6%, 90.7 ± 1.5%, 81.3 ± 1.5%, 96.3 ± 0.6%, and 72.0 ± 2.0% for the PE-fed, PS-fed, PVC-fed, bran-fed, and unfed mealworms, respectively, by the end of the experiment (Fig. S2 and Table S1). The results were consistent with the changes in the body weights of the mealworm groups over the period (Figs. 1b and 1c). These findings implied that ingesting microplastics as an exogenous food source could provide energy for the survival of mealworm larvae and sustain their growth, although this specialized energy source was not as efficient as the normal food (wheat bran). A plastic diet alone could cause nutrient exhaustion and a lack of trace elements required for the production of both digestive enzymes and transporters [31,38], leading to decreased nutrient uptake and, as a result, negative growth of the mealworms.

Interestingly, the survival curves of the PE-fed and PS-fed mealworms over the period were not statistically different, while those were both significantly different from that of the PVC-fed mealworms (Fig. 1a). Similarly, a relatively lower body weight of mealworms was also found in the PVC-fed group compared with those fed with PE and PS microplastics after 24 days (Fig. 1c, Table S2 and S3). The degradation of


PVC was partial, and the extent of PVC mineralization was comparatively limited during the insect-mediated biodegradation [13,26,64], which supplied less available energy and carbon sources. Toxic substances, e.g., chlorinated intermediates (up to 63%) and hydrogen chloride, were also produced during the PVC depolymerization process [26], which might impair the intestinal epithelium and damage the homeostasis of mealworms. The combined factors resulted in the poor survival status and physiological responses of the PVC-fed mealworms during the experiment (Fig. 1a-c and Table S1-3). Future studies on invertebrate-mediated plastic biodegradation should identify the impact of degradation intermediates and mineralization products on the invertebrate and degradation processes.

\subsection*{3.2. Evidence of biodegradation of the microplastics}

GPC analysis was applied to obtain evidence of polymer depolymerization and confirm the biodegradation of the ingested plastics by mealworms. The \(M_{w}, M_{n}\), and \(M_{z}\) of the ingested PS significantly decreased from \(180.7 \pm 5.1 \mathrm{kDa}, 74.6 \pm 3.3 \mathrm{kDa}\), and \(376.4 \pm 18.7 \mathrm{kDa}\) to \(131.3 \pm 6.0 \mathrm{kDa}\) (by \(27.34 \pm 3.32 \%)\), \(48.5 \pm 0.8 \mathrm{kDa}\) (by \(34.99 \pm 1.07 \%)\), and \(281.8 \pm 14.5 \mathrm{kDa}\) (by \(25.13 \pm 3.85 \%\) ) after mealworm digestion (Fig. 1d-i and Table 1), suggesting a typical broad depolymerization pattern as shown in previous studies [28,56,59]. The ingested PVC exhibited a similar depolymerization pattern as that of the ingested PS microplastics, i.e., the \(M_{w}, M_{n}\), and \(M_{z}\) were reduced by \(26.27 \pm 4.47 \%, 32.98 \pm 4.97 \%\), and \(21.10 \pm 3.47 \%\), respectively (Fig. 1g-i). On the other hand, the PDI of the recovered PS and PVC residue in frass (2.707 and 2.151) was both higher than that of the original PS and PVC microplastics (2.422 and 1.955) (Table 1). The increase in the PDI value suggested the random internal scission (or endo-type depolymerization) of polymer macromolecules [10], yielding mid- and short-chain polymers with heterogeneous molecular weight distributions in the intestine of mealworms. Taken together, these data indicated that the polymer chains of the ingested PS and PVC were effectively shortened and reduced after passage through the gut of mealworms, demonstrating the biodegradation of the microplastics.

The molecular weights of the ingested PE microplastics also significantly changed after mealworm digestion (Fig. 1d-i). The \(M_{w}, M_{n}\), and \(M_{z}\) values of the recovered PE residue increased by \(30.77 \pm 2.30 \%, 22.68 \pm 3.14 \%\), and \(31.28 \pm 5.73 \%\), respectively, compared to those of the original PE microplastics (Table 1), revealing a limited-extent depolymerization pattern of the ingested PE polymers [28,56,59]. The limited-extent depolymerization pattern could be attributed to the functional enzymes and gut bacterial consortiums of mealworms reacting slowly on the long-chain PE polymers with high molecular weights but attacking the short-chain and side-chain PE polymers more efficiently, resulting in the accumulation of the long-chain portion and an increase in the \(M_{w}, M_{n}\), and \(M_{z}\) values. The difference in the depolymerization patterns of the polymers

### Abstract

Plastic waste has been considered a serious global environmental problem for decades. Despite the high recalcitrance of synthetic plastics, the biodegradation of polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) by some insect larvae has been reported; however, the mechanism of degradation remains largely unknown. We investigated the effects of plastics on the growth of mealworms (larvae of Tenebrio molitor) and their role in PS and PE degradation. Mealworms were capable of ingesting high-impact polystyrene (HIPS), expanded polystyrene (EPS) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) but not linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) or polypropylene (PP). Plastic consumption was negatively dependent on plastic crystallinity. Transcriptome analysis and KEGG mapping revealed that mealworms act as downstream decomposers in plastic depolymerization and that fatty acid degradation pathways may play important roles in the digestion of plastic degradation intermediates produced by gut bacteria. In addition, PS and PE degradation was achieved via the diffusion of extracellular depolymerases, which probably acted on the distal backbone and produce shorter linear chains that containing ≤16 C atoms instead of branched chains. Additionally, the intermediates of PS degradation are expected to be further decomposed by mealworms as xenobiotics. This study provided a preliminary understanding of plastic degradation mechanism by mealworms.

1. Introduction

Worldwide plastic production was reported to be 368 million tonnes in 2019 (PlasticsEurope, 2020), and 400 million tonnes of thermoplastics were produced globally in 2020 (Tieso, 2021a). The major non-hydrolysable plastics include polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), based on their production worldwide in 2018 (Tieso, 2021b), i.e. PE, 32%; PP, 23%; PVC, 16% and PS, 7%. This enormous plastic production has imposed an immense burden in terms of waste management since polyolefins are largely nonbiodegradable.

Degrading recalcitrant plastics using insects has become a trendy topic globally. Gerhardt and Lindgren (1954) reported the ability of 9 species of common stored-product insects (Tenebroides mauritianus, Tribolium confusum, Stegobium panicum, Blattella germanica, Sitophilus granarius, Plodia interpunctella, Rhysopertha dominica, Euphestia kuehniella and Sitophilus oryzae) to penetrate PE films. Holes and scratches in PP, PE and polyester films produced by adults of R. dominica and S. oryzae have been observed under scanning electron microscopy (Riudavets et al., 2007). Two bacterial strains, Enterobacter asburiae YT1 and Bacillus sp. YP1, isolated from waxworm gut, were shown to achieve PE film degradation rates of 6.1% and 10.7% in their suspension cultures (10^8 cells mL^-1), respectively (Yang et al., 2014).

Mealworms (larvae of Tenebrio molitor) have been found to degrade expanded PS, PE, PP, PVC and polyactic acid (PLA) to lower-molecular-weight products, even CO2 (Brandon et al., 2018; Peng et al., 2020b, 2021; Yang et al., 2015, 2021a, 2021b). Degradation capabilities of expanded PS, PE, PP and rigid PS, PE, PVC by mealworm were evaluated by changes in number-, weight-, and size-average molecular weight (Mn, Mw
