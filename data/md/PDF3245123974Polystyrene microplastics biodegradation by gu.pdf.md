### Abstract
Sustainable plastic is used throughout daily life and industry, threatening organisms with microplastic pollution. Polystyrene is a major plastic polymer and also widely found sources of plastic wastes and microplastics. Here, we report that Enterobacter hormaechei LG3 (CP118279.1), a facultative anaerobic bacterial strain isolated from the gut of Tenebrio molitor larvae (mealworms) can oxidize and depolymerize polystyrene under anaerobic conditions. LG3 performed biodegradation while forming a biofilm on the plastic surface. PS biodegradation was characterized by analyses of surface oxidation, change in morphology and molecular weights, and production of biodegraded derivative. The biodegradation performance by LG3 was compared with PS biodegradation by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SCGB1 under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. In addition, through nanopore sequencing technology, we identified degradative enzymes, including thiol peroxidase (tpx), alkyl hydroperoxide reductase C (ahpC) and bacterioferritin comigratory protein (bcp). Along with the upregulation of degradative enzymes for biodegradation, changes in lipid A and biofilm-associated proteins were also observed after the cells were incubated with polystyrene microplastics. Our results provide evidence for anaerobic biodegradation by polystyrene-degrading bacteria and show alterations in gene expression patterns after polystyrene microplastics treatment in the opportunistic pathogen Enterobacter hormaechei.

# Introduction

Polystyrene (PS) is a synthetic plastic that has a long hydrocarbon chain with a phenyl group attached to every other carbon atom, and it is widely used throughout daily life and industry. The COVID-19 impact induced plastic consumption and the production of global polystyrene and expandable polystyrene steadily increased, exceeding 73.7 million metric tons in 2021 [56]. In particular, expanded polystyrene (EPS) occupies the largest portion of the PS market due to its exceptional balance of lightness, shock absorption, insulation, and indefectibility [47]. EPS is used as food contact materials, product packaging containers, and aquaculture buoys, so they are often exposed to marine life as well as human life [38,39].

The use of EPS buoys in territorial waters has been banned by the Korean government due to their role in producing Polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) and the associated risks; however, many countries are still using EPS buoys for aquaculture [12]. Moreover, unretrieved EPS buoys eventually turn into environmental pollutants in the sea because EPS may be a microplastic supplier with vulnerability to abrasion [21, 38,4]. Microplastics (MPs) can be ingested by small organisms and can accumulate in the gut due to their high resistance to degradation and strong binding ability. Cole et al., [14,59,62]. Consequently, MPs are widely observed in not only fish and fish meals but also agricultural feedstocks and livestock, including pigs, cattle, and chickens, through transmission between organisms [101,46,81].

MPs, directly or indirectly transferred into the body, can contact the gastrointestinal tract and interact with the commensal bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae and Bacillaceae, in the intestinal rumen, and are available resources to plastic-degrading gut bacteria [1,43,54,75]. However, recent studies have focused PS-degrading gut bacteria under aerobic conditions, rather than anaerobic conditions [55]. In previous studies, PS-degrading gut bacterium Exiguobacterium YT2 was isolated [99] and 8 strains of gut microbes were identified from the guts of mealworms [6], Kim et al. [35] isolated PS-degrading Pseudomonas strain DSM 50071 from the gut of Superworms (Zophobas atratus) larvae [35]. Both studies indicated that the isolated bacterial cultures degraded PS in the presence of oxygen i.e. under aerobic conditions. Therefore, further studies should focus on investigating novel bacteria capable of degrading plastics under anaerobic conditions.

Mealworms (larvae of Tenebrio molitor) are known to digest PS and polyethylene (PE) materials, and antibiotics studies have indicated that the gut microbiota of mealworms plays an essential role in the biodegradation of PS [5,97,99]. Researchers have also revealed that gut bacteria play an important role in mealworms' ability to adapt to plastic feeds [45,99]. However, previous studies with plastic-degrading microorganisms were performed in an oxygen-rich environment, which contrasts with the oxygen-limited gut environment of mealworms [30,6,86,99]. There is an oxygen-limited condition across the intestinal tract of mealworms due to microbiota in the lumen and close to the gut wall, as the hindgut features diverse genera of anaerobes, including Clostridium, Enterobacter, and Spiroplasma [20,5,84,86]. Collectively, the possibility of PS biodegradation by gut microorganisms under oxygen-limited and even anaerobic conditions should be investigated to fill the scientific gap.

In this study, we isolated a bacterial strain of Enterobacter spp. from the gut of mealworms under an oxygen-limited environment, which functioned as facultative PS-degrading gut microbes. Enterobacter spp. are facultative gut bacteria and opportunistic pathogens, and their impact on the host can vary significantly depending on the environment [9,63]. In certain environments, Enterobacter spp. make probiotics effects by activating the host's immune system and enhancing immune response [40,42]. However, in different environments, they can also cause a decline in the host's health due to released endotoxins [15,37]. Enterobacter hormaechei LG3, which has PS degradation activity under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions, when utilizing microspheres PS (Mi-PS) as a carbon source under anaerobic conditions, exhibits physiological changes such as biofilm formation and endotoxin synthesis pathways based on whole genome and transcriptomes sequencing. This is accompanied by the upregulation of degradative enzyme genes such as tpx, ahpC and bcp associated with PS degradation.

Furthermore, we conducted a comparative analysis of biodegradation using different PS materials, including emulsified-PS, PS film, and Mi-PS, under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SCGB1 was used to confirm the PS degradation of Enterobacter hormaechei LG3. Species of B. amyloliquefaciens is facultative gut bacterium that has been recognized for its influence on gut health in the host [18,31,49] and is known for their PS and PE degradation activity [26,92]. The comprehensive analysis including mass reduction of PS film, cell viability, GPC, WCA, FTIR, and SPME/GC—MS revealed metabolic differences in PS degradation between the two distinct strains, providing phylogenetic differentiation.

\section*{2. Materials and methods}

\subsection*{2.1. Experimental model and subject details}

\subsection*{2.1.1. T. molitor larvae}

Two groups of T. molitor larvae of different ages and sites were obtained. The early instar group (< 10 mm and 0.03 g) was purchased from Anifoodfarm (Insects Breeding Plant, Namyangju, South Korea). The late instar group (> 20 mm and 0.1 g) was received from Daeanfeed company (Icheon, South Korea). Both groups were maintained in an incubator at \(25{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) and \(60 \%\) humidity, and were fed only PS foams (provided by SWEPS company (Chungju, South Korea)) and water for 2 weeks.

\subsection*{2.1.2. PS foams, PS films, and Mi-PS}

PS foams were source from commercially available products. PS films were purchased from the Goodfellow company (Huntingdon, UK). Microspheres PS (Mi-PS) with a diameter of \(1 \mu \mathrm{m}\) were obtained as beads from the Polysciences company (Warrington, USA). Mi-PS are internally PC Red dyed using dye entrapment. The dyes remain trapped in the beads in aqueous environments. The PS materials (0.1 g) dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF). The weight average molecular weight \(\left(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{w}}\right)\), number average molecular weight \(\left(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{n}}\right)\), and z-average molecular weight \(\left(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{z}}\right)\) of THF-dissolved PS materials were analyzed using gel permeation chromatography (GPC, Ultimate 3000, Thermo) [96]. The \(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{w}}\) values of PS foams, PS films, Mi-PS, PS emulsion were 247,800 Da, 314,700 Da, 276,700 Da, and 284,800 Da, respectively (Supplementary Table 1).

\subsection*{2.1.3. PS emulsion}

The following process was performed in a fume hood to prepare the PS emulsion [86]. First, 5 g of PS foams were dissolved in 50 mL of dichloromethane. Then, the 50 mL of 1\% sarkosyl NL was added and mixed. The mixture was sonicated using an ultrasonic homogenizer (KUS-650, KBT) for 10 min. Next, 100 mL of distilled water was added to the PS emulsion and vigorously stirred for 30 min using a stirrer (MSH-20A, Daihan Scientific). To evaporate the dichloromethane in the mixed solution, the solution was stirred at \(80{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) for 6 h. The PS emulsion volume was maintained between 100 and \(200 \mathrm{~mL}\) by adding distilled water. After the filtration process using filter paper (HM.5012055, Hyundai Micro), the weight of the filtered PS was measured to calculate the PS content in the emulsion. The average particle sizes of PS emulsion was measured by using particle size

2.2. Isolation and identification of PS-degrading bacteria

2.2.1. Enrichment culture

Separate experiments were conducted using two groups: an early instar larva group and a late instar larva group, with limited feeding of PS foams for 14 days, to establish enrichment cultures (Supplementary Table S2). We prepared four different variants as follows: 1) EG: using gut samples from early instar larvae, 2) EF: using frass samples acquired from early instar larvae, 3) LG: using gut samples acquired from late instar larvae, and 4) LF: using frass samples acquired from late instar larvae. Enrichment cultures were performed using emulsified PS (ePS) containing fungal minimum medium (FMM) with the following components: 2 g L⁻¹ sodium phosphate monobasic 0.5 g L⁻¹ magnesium sulfate heptahydrate 0.2 g L⁻¹ monopotassium phosphate, 1 g L⁻¹ yeast extract, 0.5 g L⁻¹ L-cysteine hydrochloride, 0.05 g L⁻¹ Sarkosyl NL, and 5 g L⁻¹ PS foam [86]. After filling a 50 mL conical tube with 20 mL of FMM, each of the frass and gut samples was inoculated into the ePS-containing FMM medium. The inoculation process was conducted in a vinyl anaerobic chamber equipped with a vacuum airlock (032714, Coy Labs). The conical tube was then vortexed for 5 min, following a 10-minute waiting period to allow the tissue or feces to settle. The settled material was subsequently removed using a pipette. The conical tube containing the FMM suspension was incubated for 5 days under anaerobic conditions to provide a favorable environment for anaerobic PS-degradable bacteria [95,100].

2.2.2. Isolation of anaerobic polystyrene-degrading microorganisms

After 5 days of preincubation, the ePS-containing FMM medium inoculated with the specimen showed changes in turbidity. Cultured microorganisms were isolated through serial dilution. Aliquots (0.1 mL) of preincubated suspension in ePS-containing FMM medium were spread onto Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates. After incubation for 48 h at 37 °C under anaerobic conditions, the grown colonies were isolated and streaked onto other plates with ePS-containing FMM agar. The colonies that formed clear zones were selected for further analysis. A total of ten strains were isolated from the gut and frass of the larvae. The strain names of the isolated bacteria were assigned based on the samples. For example, EG1 and EF1 were named to represent strains isolated from the gut and frass of early instar larvae, respectively.

2.2.3. L-cysteine hydrochloride

The FMM medium used in this experiment contains 0.5 g L⁻¹ of L-cysteine hydrochloride for microbial cultivation under anaerobic conditions. L-cysteine hydrochloride is utilized as a reducing agent to enhance efficiency of anaerobic conditions by scavenging minuscule amounts of oxygen in medium [91]. The presence of trace amounts of L-cysteine hydrochloride in the FMM medium did not significantly affect PS degradation under anaerobic conditions (Supplementary Fig. S2).

2.2.4. Atmosphere conditions of anaerobic chamber

Nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas were introduced into the chamber through two lines: the background gas line and the pre-mixed gas line. The background gas line supplies pure nitrogen, while the pre-mixed gas line supplies a mixture of 5% hydrogen with nitrogen as the balance. Two heated fan boxes with a palladium catalyst and a hydrogen sulfide removal column are placed inside the anaerobic chamber. The heated fan boxes with a palladium catalyst remove traces of O₂ from the atmosphere of chamber using H₂, maintain temperature, and provide a homogeneous mix of gases in the chamber. The hydrogen sulfide removal column removes H₂S by continuously recirculating the chamber's atmosphere through the column. Throughout the experiment, the temperature was consistently maintained at 37 °C, and the humidity level ranged from 30% to 40%. The levels of O₂ and H₂ equilibrated to 0–25 parts per million (ppm) and 2.5–3%, respectively.

2.2.5. Identification and phylogenetic analysis

The selected bacteria, which formed clear zones on FMM agar plates, were identified through 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. The HiGene™ Genomic DNA prep kit for Bacterium (GD262–060, BIOFACT) was used according to the manufacturer's manual. Amplification of the 16 S rRNA gene was performed with the universal primers 27-F (5'- TACGGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT -3') and 1492-R (5'- CCAGCAGCGCGGTAAATCAG -3'). The obtained approximately 1500 bp sequences were aligned with organisms present in the GenBank database using BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) created by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, USA. The 16 S rRNA gene-based evolutionary tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method and with the Kimura two-parameter Model using MEGA X. The 16 S rRNA sequences of ten isolated strains from mealworms (EG1, EG2, EF1, EF2, LG1, LG2, LG3, LF1, LF2, and LF3) have been deposited in GenBank with the following accession numbers: QQ253539, QQ253542, QQ253543, QQ253544, QQ253545, QQ253550, QQ253551, QQ253553, QQ253554, and QQ253563, respectively.

2.3. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SCGB1

B. amyloliquefaciens SCGB1, which was isolated from traditional Korean soybean-fermented foods, was provided from the Microbial Institute for Fermentation Industry (Sunchang, South Korea). This strain SCGB1 can affect intestinal health of mice [31] and is capable of growing under anaerobic conditions in a nutritionally rich medium, such as LB broth, or on LB agar plates (Supplementary Fig. S3).

2.4. Biodegradation assay

2.4.1. Biodegradation assay in liquid FMM medium

To prevent PS films from overlapping and increase the available surface area for microorganism adhesion, three pieces of crumpled PS films weighing 93 ± 0.1 mg were used as a carbon source in 20 mL of liquid FMM medium. The PS film was disinfected with 70% ethanol and underwent an air-drying process in a laminar-flow clean bench before being placed into the FMM medium. The FMM medium containing 2 g L⁻¹ sodium phosphate monobasic 0.5 g L⁻¹ magnesium sulfate heptahydrate 0.2 g L⁻¹ monopotassium phosphate, 1 g L⁻¹ yeast extract, 0.5 g L⁻¹ L-cysteine hydrochloride. The incubated bacterial cell suspensions (10⁹ CFU mL⁻¹) were resuspended three times in sterile saline water (SW). Aliquots (0.01 mL) of washed cell suspensions (10⁹ CFU mL⁻¹) were inoculated into the FMM medium. To establish aerobic and anaerobic conditions, different caps were used: an air-permeable silicone rubber cap for aerobic conditions and a sealed butyl cap for anaerobic conditions (Supplementary Fig. S4). The samples were cultured for 15 days at 37 °C in shaker incubators (120 rpm) or stationary incubators. After 15 days of inoculation, the bottles containing the PS films were shaken on a vortex mixer for 5 min to detach the bacteria from films. The bacterial cell numbers in the medium were determined using the series dilution method of plate counting. Next, a PS film was transferred into another centrifuge tube containing 40 mL of aqueous solution with 2% (w v⁻¹) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for 4 h and then rinsed with 70% (v v⁻¹) ethanol solution. Following treatment, it was confirmed that no cells were observed on the surface of the air-dried PS film. The change in the weight of the PS film was determined by measurement. (PX224KR, OHAUS) [8]. The specifications of this model are as follows: Draftshield Included, Readability of 0.1 mg, Repeatability of 0.0001 g, Stabilization Time of 2 s, and Linearity of ± 0.0002 g.

2.4.2. Biodegradation assay on FMM

2.8. Solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography (SPME/GC—MS) mass spectrometry analysis

Triplicate bottles were prepared for each sample, with each bottle containing 10 mL of FMM supplemented with 0.075% Mi-PS. The cell suspensions with a concentration of 10^9 CFU mL^-1 were resuspended three times in SW. Aliquots (0.1 mL) of washed cell suspension (10^9 CFU mL^-1) were inoculated into the FMM solution containing 0.075% Mi-PS. The bottles were incubated for 10 days at 37 °C in shaker incubators (120 rpm) or stationary incubators, under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions as described previously. The incubated solution was detected using the SPME/GC—MS method [71]. Chromatographic analyses were performed using a Thermo TRACE 1310/TSQ 8000 gas chromatography & mass spectrometer equipped with a DB-Wax (122–7063, Agilent) capillary column. Pure helium gas (He, 99.999%) was used as the carrier gas. The GC conditions were as follows: the sample (1.6 mL) was injected to inlet at 250 °C in split mode (10:1) under a flow rate of 20 mL min^-1, the GC oven temperature was programmed to hold at 40 °C for 2 min, then to increase from 40 °C to 150 °C at 4 °C min^-1; then to hold at 150 °C for 10 min, then to increase from 150 °C to 200 °C at 4 °C min^-1; then to hold at 200 °C for 5 min, then to increase from 200 °C to 230 °C at 4 °C min^-1; then to hold at 230 for 5 min. The 1,2,3-Trichloropropene was used as the internal standard for quantitative analysis. The spectral clusters were identified by searching against the NIST/EPA/NICHD Mass spectral library (v. 2.4 g) using the NIST mass spectral search program.

2.9. Bacterial-generated methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration analysis

The CH4 and CO2 concentrations were detected using gas chromatography (GC, Chrozen GC System, Younig Chromass) equipped with a PDD detector and a continuous column of molecular sieve 13X (13047-U) and Porapak-N (13052-U). Aliquots (0.1 mL) of cell suspension (10^9 CFU mL^-1) were inoculated into serum vials containing FMM medium with 0.075% (w v^-1) Mi-PS, following the procedure described above. The GC equipped with a PDD detector had a detection limit (DL = 3n/S) of 743 ppm for CO2 and 397 ppm for CH4. Triplicate samples were tested at incubation periods of 0, 2, 5, 10, and 20 days at 37 °C in anaerobic conditions. For the zero-day incubation, samples were collected after 3 h of inoculation. Aliquots (250 μL) of headspace were collected using a gastight syringe (1750 RN) and injected into the GC inlet. Pure He was employed as the carrier gas. Standard curves for CH4 and CO2 were constructed using a standard gas mixture consisting of known concentrations of the gases dissolved in pure He as the background gas. The inlet temperature was 150 °C; the detector was at 220 °C; the oven was programmed to hold at 40 °C for 5 min, then to increase from 40 °C to 220 °C at 15 °C min^-1, then to hold at 220 °C for 5 min. The retention time for H2 was 2.630 min; N2, 4.267 min, CH4, 9.243 min; CO2, 12.052 min

2.10. Whole genome sequence analysis

The strain LG3 was grown on 1.5% LB agar for 2 days at 37 °C. A single colony from the plate was transferred into a 1.5 mL micro-centrifuge tube containing 1 mL SW. Genomic DNA (gDNA) extraction was performed using the HiGene™ Genomic DNA prep kit for Bacterium (GD262–060). The obtained gDNA was processed according to the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) protocol (SQK-LSK109) for ligation sequencing and purification [34,76]. The gDNA library of strain LG3 was sequenced in an R9.4.1 flow cell on a MinION Mk1B instrument provided by ONT. Bacterial whole genome analysis was based on a constructed pipeline (Supplementary Fig. 11A). The reads with a size of at least 1000 bp were assembled into a single genome using the Flye (v.2.9.1) assembler. The single genome was annotated using the Prokka (v.1.13.4) gene prediction method through automated computational analysis. The detailed command codes used for whole genome analysis

Strain LG3 was incubated on LB agar for 2 days at 37 °C. A single colony from the plate was transferred into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube that contained 1 mL SW and vortexed for 1 min. Aliquots (10 μL) of the cell suspension were inoculated either on a petri dish containing 20 mL of FMM medium with 1 μm microspheres polystyrene (0.075%, w v−1) or on FMM agar containing maltose monohydrate (0.075%, w v−1). After a 10-day incubation at 37 °C in an anaerobic jar, the colonies were harvested and immediately combined with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA extraction was performed using a RNeasy Mini Kit (74104, Qiagen). The quality of the RNA was assessed using a SpectraMax ABS Plus instrument (Molecular Devices). Total RNA was quantified using a Qubit 4 fluorometer (Invitrogen) with the Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The extracted total RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified using Eppendorf Mastercycler Pro Thermal Cyclers (EP950040025, Eppendorf) and a cDNA-PCR Sequencing Kit (SQK-PCB109, ONT). The cDNA library of strain LG3 was loaded into an R9.4.1 flow cell and sequenced on a MinION Mk1B provided by ONT. Bacterial total RNA analysis was performed using a constructed pipeline (Supplementary Fig. 11B). The reads with a size of at least 200 bp and above Q10 were retained during basecalling (Option: FLO-MIN106/FLO-FLG001 DNA - super - accurate). The Salmon (v.1.9.0) and Prokka tools were utilized to perform quasimapping of sequencing reads for gene expression quantification. Detailed command codes for this analysis can be found in the supplementary nanopore sequencing analysis file. The raw transcriptome sequencing data has been deposited in NCBI under the SRA, and the data accession number is SRR23339333.

Statistical analysis

If not specified otherwise, all values are presented as the mean ± Standard Deviation (SD) and were derived from three or more experiments. GraphPad Prism 9 software was used to statistically analyze the majority of experimental data by one-way ANOVA. Multiple comparisons were performed using Tukey's test, and the results were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. Multiple t tests using the two-stage step-up method were applied to analyze the results from SPME/ GC-MS. The significance levels are indicated by asterisks (* P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001, **** P < 0.0001).

Results

Enrichment culture and screening for anaerobic PS-degrading isolates

Enrichment culture procedures were employed, to isolate anaerobic PS-degrading bacteria from the gut and frass specimens of mealworms fed with PS foams (Fig. 1A). The isolates were incubated on emulsified PS (ePS)-containing FMM agar plates, where certain bacterial strains form distinct clear zones around colonies under anaerobic conditions (Fig. 1B). Strains unable to degrade ePS under anaerobic conditions either do not form colonies on ePS-containing FMM agar plates or, if they do, fail to produce a clear zone (Supplementary Fig. S5A). However, certain strains capable of ePS degradation under anaerobic conditions expand the size of the clear zone around the colonies as they grow, resulting in the formation of a distinct clear zone by day 3 of incubation (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Additionally, these strains showed ePS degradation activity not only under anaerobic conditions but also under aerobic conditions (Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6B, and Supplementary Table 3).

Subsequently, six strains (LF1, LF2, LF3, LG1, LG2, LG3) from the late-instar larva group and four strains (EF1, EF2, EG1, EG2) from the early-instar larva group were selected for identification. Based on the phylogenetic analysis using sequence of 16 S rRNA, these strains were classified within the Enterobacter genus (Fig. 1C, and Supplementary Table 2). The facultative PS-degrading isolates obtained in this experiment were identified as the same species as previously reported bacteria, with their 16 S rRNA sequences showing a sequence identity of ≥ 97.8% to Enterobacter cancergenus, Enterobacter quasihormaechei, or Enterobacter hormaechei subs. Xiangfangensis [16,48,80,89]. Among the isolated strains, Enterobacter sp. LG3, which showed a high sequence similarity to Enterobacter hormaechei based on the 16 S rRNA sequence, formed colonies with a diameter of 12.30 ± 0.30 mm and clear zones with a diameter of 23.73 ± 0.84 mm on ePS-containing FMM agar plate after 120 h of incubation under anaerobic conditions (Supplementary Table 3). The strain LG3 exhibited the highest ePS-degrading activity under anaerobic conditions compared to other isolated strains. Considering that strain LG3 has high anaerobic PS-degrading activity in the gut of late-instar PS-fed larvae, further research was conducted to investigate bioreactions for PS.

Weight loss of PS film by PS-degraders under aerobic and anaerobic conditions

The gravimetric determination of weight loss is widely used as an indicator to assess biodegradation. Wu, Criddle [94]. A comparative analysis was conducted to compare the PS degradation activities between strain LG3, which exhibited the highest activity among the PS-degraders isolated from the mealworm gut, and strain SCGB1, a bacterium belonging to the same species as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and reported as both a PE- and PS-degrading organism [26,92]. To evaluate the PS degradation capabilities of the two strains, changes in the PS film weight were examined under aerobic and anaerobic conditions in FMM medium. Aerobic conditions were maintained using a shaking incubator (120 rpm), while anaerobic conditions were established by incubating the samples either in a shaking incubator (120 rpm) or a stationary incubator for a duration of 15 days (Supplementary Fig. S4). Strain LG3 exhibited significant weight reduction of PS films under all conditions compared to the sterile control (Fig. 2A). Specifically, under stationary-anaerobic conditions, LG3 displayed the greatest weight reduction of 2.76 ± 0.22%, followed by a reduction of 1.94 ± 0.18% under aerobic conditions, and 1.47 ± 0.33% under agitating-anaerobic conditions. In the case of SCGB1, it showed a significant weight reduction of 1.36 ± 0.13% of the PS film only under aerobic conditions, indicating a significant difference compared to the control. However, no significant differences were observed for SCGB1 under any of the anaerobic conditions (Fig. 2A). When measuring the CFU concentration of these PS-degraders utilizing the PS film as a carbon source, both LG3 and SCGB1 exhibited the highest concentrations under aerobic conditions (Fig. 2B). Moreover, similar trends were observed on FMM agar plates with PS film, where LG3 was able to degrade the PS film under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions (Fig. 2C). The PS films exposed to SCGB1 exhibited a significant weight difference between aerobic and anaerobic conditions (Fig. 2D). The results demonstrated that strain LG3 is capable of biodegrading PS under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions while strain SCGB1 can effectively degrade PS only under aerobic conditions as expected.

## 3.3. Enterobacter sp. LG3 forms biofilms and exhibits activity on the PS film under anaerobic conditions

After 30 days of anaerobic microbial culture with the PS films, strain LG3 generated a noticeable microbial community at the periphery of the PS films (Fig. 3A). The cells of strain LG3 were observed on the surface of the PS films using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and they formed biofilms via intercellular attachment using appendages (Fig. 3B). In particular, the appendages of strain LG3 adhered to the PS film surface, and cavities due to biodegradation were also detected at the periphery of the attachment site (Fig. 3C). These types of cavities were not observed in the PS films exposed to B. amyloliquefaciens and the sterile control under anaerobic conditions (Figs. 3D and 3E).

## 3.4. Comparison of cell activities as PS-degraders under anaerobic conditions

To assess the activity of an anaerobic PS-degrader, a homogenized bacterial cell suspension was directly exposed to PS films on FMM agar medium, and changes such as cell adhesion, viability, and PS film weight were observed. Strain LG3 formed white colonies in the space between the FMM agar medium and the PS film (Fig. 4A). When assessing the cell adhesion activity on the PS films, Enterobacter sp. LG3 peaked on the 5th day and then gradually decreased, demonstrating a 2.39% decrease from the peak by the 30th day (Fig. 4B). On the other hand, B. amyloliquefaciens SCGB1 reached the highest concentration on the 10th day and then displayed a strong inflection toward a decrease,

Next, to measure the amount of CO2, the final metabolite of PS, GC analysis was conducted over a 20-day period under anaerobic conditions [33,98]. The concentration of CO2 in the headspace of LG3 showed a rapid increase, resulting in a significant difference by day 20 (Fig. 6D and Supplementary Fig. S10). The headspace of the bottle containing LG3 exhibited a CO2 concentration of 2.27 ± 0.13% on day 0, which increased to 4.08 ± 0.34% by day 20. Finally, the interaction between Mi-PS and bacteria under anaerobic conditions was visualized using FE-SEM (Fig. 6E-6 G). Identical 1 μm spherical beads were observed in the sterile control (Fig. 6E), whereas microsphere beads incubated with strain LG3 showed rough and dented surfaces due to PS biodegradation (Fig. 6F). Microsphere beads incubated with SCGB1 were not degraded, but disrupted cells and fragments were observed (Fig. 6G). These comparative experiments demonstrated that LG3 exhibited more effective depolymerization of oxidized PS than SCGB1 under anaerobic conditions.

3.7. Genomic analysis of strain LG3 when metabolizing Mi-PS under anaerobic conditions

To identify the key enzymes involved in the cleavage of PS under anaerobic conditions in the LG3 genome, we utilized nanopore sequencing [90]. The bioinformatics methods were employed to exploit reads according to constructed pipelines (Supplementary Fig. S11A and S11B). A genome sequence-based analysis confirmed that strain LG3 is the same species as Enterobacter hormaechei (Supplementary Fig. S12A-C). The single circular genome, yielding 4514,131 bp with 55.54% GC content, was used to construct a genome map with potential PS-degrading enzyme genes (Fig. 7A). In addition, transcriptomes of LG3 using Mi-PS or maltose as carbon sources were sequenced to identify the enzymes related to PS biodegradation under anaerobic conditions (Supplementary Fig. S13 and S14). We selected specific enzymes reactive to aryl alcohol compounds among the potential PS-degrading enzymes and analyzed their expression levels (Fig. 7B). Peroxidase (efeB) and hydrolase (ubi genes) for aryl alcohol compounds were upregulated; however, oxidase (yfiH) and monoxygenase (paa genes) involved in aryl alcohol compounds were not upregulated when using Mi-PS. Next, differentially expressed genes were ranked regarding their fold change between Mi-PS and maltose (Supplementary Fig. S15A, B), and they were further categorized according to their functions (Fig. 7C, D and Supplementary Table S4 and S5). We observed differential expression of specific degradative enzymes as well as metabolic pathway enzymes (Fig. 7C, 7D).

After Mi-PS treatment, the expression levels of thiol peroxidase (pxc), alkyl hydroperoxide reductase C (ahpC), and bacterioferritin comigratory protein (bcp) genes, which belong to the same peroxidase family [10], were substantially increased (Fig. 7E), and enzymes involved in lipid A synthesis pathway were also upregulated (Fig. 7F and Supplementary Table S6). In contrast, when using Mi-PS instead of maltose, flagellar protein-coding genes such as Flagellar brake protein (ycgR), Flagellar L-ring protein (flgH), and Flagellar biosynthetic protein (flp) were downregulated (Fig. 7G), and enzymes in the glycolytic pathway showed downregulation (Fig. 7H and Supplementary Table S7).

4. Discussion

In this study, we report that E. hormaechei LG3, isolated from the PS-fed mealworm gut, can effectively oxidize, and depolymerize PS under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions in comparison to B. amyloliquefaciens SCGB1. The facultative PS-degrader, strain LG3, exhibited remarkable biodegradation ability, forming a biofilm on the surface of various PS materials, including ePS, PS film, and Mi-PS, even in the absence of oxygen gas. Additionally, strain LG3 demonstrated efficient PS degradation under aerobic conditions as well. The PS materials resulted in noticeable morphological and physicochemical changes attributed to anaerobic biodegradation [25,86,99]. In addition,

and bacterial cells. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. through a comparison of the metabolic products under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, we confirmed that LG3 and SCGB1 exhibit differences in the process of PS metabolism depending on the presence of oxygen gas. In transcriptome and metabolite analyses, we observed the upregulation of degradative enzymes such as peroxidase and hydroxylase, along with the detection of corresponding depolymerized PS derivatives after anaerobic PS biodegradation [19]. Collectively, these results showed that Enterobacter LG3 effectively degrades PS under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions.

To date, there has been much controversy over the core bacteria involved in PS biodegradation in the mealworm gut microbiota because the isolated PS-degrading species are completely different in each experiment within the same host [20,30,84,86,99]. In this experiment, mealworm specimens were spatially and temporally divided (Supplementary Table S2), but all of the isolated strains with activity on PS under anaerobic conditions belonged to the Enterobacter genus [67,86, 95]. Enterobacter spp. are mainly distributed in the oxygen-limited posterior gut section of mealworms [20,5,84,86], and when PS or PE is fed to mealworms, they increase their composition in the host gut microbiome [5,86]. The gradual decrease in oxygen levels that occurs when air-containing PS foam enters the oxygen-limited gut environment provides an advantage to Enterobacter spp., as they are capable of efficiently carrying out bioreactions under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions [20,84,86]. Collectively, Enterobacter spp. play an important role in anaerobic PS biodegradation in mealworms [67,86,95]. In addition, Enterobacter species, including E. hormaechei, which can widely exist not only in the gut of insects but also in the gut of marine fish, livestock, and even humans [53,57,72,88]. These results indicate that anaerobic degradation of PS can take place within the gut of various organisms. On the other hand, B. amyloliquefaciens SCGB1, another gut commensal bacterium, has significantly reduced PS degradation activity under anaerobic conditions. In the presence of oxygen gas, it produced specific metabolites, isobutyric acid and isovaleric acid, which are distinct from strain LG3. This indicates a difference in the mechanism for degrading PS between the two PS-degraders. The significant differences in PS activity and metabolism between LG3 and SCGB1 hold significant implications, indicating that the impact of biodegradation of PS on the host animal may also be different [7]. Further studies are needed to clarify the effects of bioreaction on Mi-PS by PS-degrading gut microbes in the actual intestinal environment of living organisms [68,69].

The two strains, LG3 and SCGB1, capable of degrading PS, showed a significant difference in the not only anaerobic but also aerobic biodegradation of PS. Regarding anaerobic oxidation, both strains oxidize the PS molecule, resulting in decreases in the WCA values. The WCA values were not significantly different between LG3 and SCGB1. Under anaerobic conditions, oxidizing chemically stable compounds such as benzene and methane requires sulfate (SO42-), nitrate (NO3-), or nitrite (NO2-) instead of oxygen (O2) [23,66,83]. Both PS-degraders are facultative anaerobic bacteria that can grow by means of anaerobic respiration using nitrate (NO3-) and nitrate (NO2-) as electron acceptors to create ATP through the respiratory electron transport process [17,29, 41]. Furthermore, the expression of denitrification enzymes was observed in the transcriptome of strain LG3 exposed to Mi-PS (Supplementary Fig. S16), suggesting that anaerobic PS oxidation is coupled to microbial nitrate reduction [32,58]. However, LG3 produced more abundant secondary products of PS under anaerobic conditions, including 2-phenylethanol and methyl 2-hydroxybenzoate, which indicates that LG3 has superior degradative enzymes that effectively cleave oxidized PS to small molecules [25,61,95]. Peroxidase is known to be a degradative enzyme on oxidized PS [19]. The expression of ipx, abpC, and bcp in the transcriptome of LG3 was substantially upregulated after treatment with Mi-PS, which are peroxiredoxins, and they have activity against oxidized lipid molecules under anaerobic conditions [10]. The superior oxidized-PS depolymerization ability of strain LG3 contributed to acquiring sufficient resources and energy to maintain cell growth ability, adhesion ability and viability at high levels [25,61,95]. In conclusion, our results suggest that anaerobic PS biodegradation proceeds in two stages, oxidation and depolymerization, and that distinct enzymes, PS oxidative enzyme and oxidized-PS degradative enzyme, exist in the LG3 genome [17,19,23,29,41,44,60].

SPME/GC-MS was used to detect PS derivative molecules, such as aromatic and alkyl compounds containing hydroxyl groups, which could be produced by peroxidase and hydrolase reactions [19,102]. Strain LG3 showed that all aromatic alcohols and aliphatic alcohols were significantly increased compared to the sterile control under anaerobic conditions. Most Enterobacter species contain two anaerobic styrene biodegradation pathways: the 2-phenylethanol route and the 2-ethylphenol route [22,82]. The chromatogram of LG3 represented peaks of 2-phenylethanol and methyl 2-hydroxybenzoate, which are intermediates of the 2-ethylphenol route and route, 2-phenylethanol respectively, which means that the anaerobic biodegradation mechanisms of PS and styrene are partially shared [102]. Finally, LG3 produced CO2 as an end product arising from anaerobic biodegradation of PS [11,22,98].

RNA-seq analysis showed that PS-degradable bacterium, LG3 changed their physiological characteristics after treatment with Mi-PS. Downregulation of cell motility-associated proteins such as ycgR, flgH and FlhA provides an advantage in maintaining immobile microbial communities and biofilms [24], which is considered the crucial early step of microbe-mediated biodegradation of plastics [25,95]. Based on the observed decrease in PS film reduction rate under the agitating-anaerobic conditions, suggesting that stable binding is an important factor in anaerobic PS degradation. This trend was also observed when utilizing Mi-PS as a carbon source, and LG3 showed not only efficient Mi-PS degrader, but also effective Mi-PS flocculants by binding Mi-PS under stationary anaerobic conditions (Supplementary Fig. S17). Another noteworthy result from RNA-seq analysis is the observed changes in the lipid metabolism pathway (Supplementary Table S6) and accompanied upregulation of lipid A biosynthesis pathway enzymes, including lipxC and lipxD [13]. Lipid A is an essential toxic component in endotoxin of opportunistic pathogens such as Enterobacter hormaechei [3,70,79]. Collectively, the Mi-PS niche induces changes in metabolic pathways for PS metabolism and alters physiological activities, including biofilm and lipid A formation to LG3, gut commensal bacterium [25,52,95]. These findings indicate that PS-MPs themselves not only have negative effects on the host but also enhance toxicity of opportunistic pathogen [28,51,68].

This study provides evidence that anaerobic PS biodegradation can be achieved by microorganisms, offering potential applications in bioremediation fields such as wastewater treatment to remove small MPs, particularly in secondary wastewater treatment systems like anaerobic lagoon systems and aerobic lagoon systems [2,36,93]. Additionally, the presence of abandoned MPs in the ocean and soil poses threats to the health and life of living organisms [14,46,62]. Though a comprehensive understanding of the step-by-step mechanism of PS biodegradation is necessary for further enzymatic studies, our findings present a novel approach to addressing plastic pollution. By demonstrating the degradation of PS-MPs under anaerobic conditions - conditions which are prevalent in the majority of animal guts - we offer a new perspective on how to mitigate the impact of such pollutants. This study contributes to the exploration of PS-degrading gut commensal bacteria to mitigate the harmful effects of PS-MPs in host intestine. We further propose that the field of bioremediation be expanded to include the intestinal environment of living organisms. To date, most isolated

PS-degrading bacteria are facultative microbes [35,6,99]. It remains unknown whether bacterial strains, e.g., Exiguobacterium strain YT2, and Pseudomonas strain DSM 50071 have similar or different abilities for PS biodegradation like strain LG3. Further research is needed to evaluate previously isolated aerobic plastic-degrading cultures.

\section*{5. Conclusions}

In this study, we successfully isolated PS-degrading bacteria from the gut and frass of PS-fed mealworms under anaerobic conditions. The isolated bacteria were identified as belonging to the Enterobacter genus. Notably, E. hormaechei LG3 showed the highest anaerobic PS-degrading activity among the other isolated strains and also effectively degraded PS under aerobic conditions. Furthermore, we compared the LG3 and SCGB1, another PS-degrading bacterium that exhibited distinct metabolic characteristics. The results showed that LG3 has higher anaerobic PS-degrading activity, including cell adhesion, viability, and PS film weight change than B. amyloliquefaciens SCGB1 under anaerobic conditions. Further analysis using FTIR and SPME/GC-MS confirmed that the difference in biodegradation ability appeared in the depolymerization of oxidized-PS under anaerobic conditions. Nanopore sequencing confirmed that in the case of LG3, the expression of the tpx, alpC, and bcp genes, which belong to the identical peroxidase family, was upregulated to depolymerize Mi-PS. Overall, this study identified and characterized E. hormaechei LG3 compared with B. amyloliquefaciens SCGB1, another gut commensal bacterium having PS degradation activity. The discovery of anaerobic PS degradation by gut microbes of T. molitor has provided new insights to the mechanisms of plastic biodegradation in insect larvae as well as in natural ecosystems, which could help in development of bioremediation approaches for the solutions of plastic debris and MPs.

Environmental Implication

Microplastics threaten organisms, accumulating in their guts, potentially entering the food chain. To date, research on plastic biodegradation has primarily focused on aerobic conditions. Anaerobic plastic-degrading has limited report although the discovery of anaerobic plastic-degrading bacteria would be of significance for potential bioremediation of Microplastics in environments, including wastewater treatment as well as and understanding plastic degradation mechanism within the gut of living organisms, especially plastic-degrading insect larvae. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the characterization of anaerobic plastic-degrading bacteria to gain a comprehensive understanding of the environmental implications of microplastic pollution.
