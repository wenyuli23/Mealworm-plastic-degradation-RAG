### ABSTRACT:
The biodegradation of polypropylene (PP), a highly persistent nonhydrolyzable polymer, by *Tenebrio molitor* has been confirmed using commercial PP microplastics (MPs) \((M_{\mathrm{w}} 26.59\) and \(M_{\mathrm{v}} 187.12 \mathrm{kDa})\). This confirmation was based on the reduction of the PP mass, change in molecular weight (MW), and a positive \(\Delta \delta^{13} \mathrm{C}\) in the residual PP. A MW-dependent biodegradation mechanism was investigated using five high-purity PP MPs, classified into low (0.83 and 6.20 kDa), medium (50.40 and 108.0 kDa), and high (575.0 kDa) MW categories to access the impact of MW on the depolymerization pattern and associated gene expression of gut bacteria and the larval host. The larvae can depolymerize/biodegrade PP polymers with high MW although the consumption rate and weight losses increased, and survival rates declined with increasing PP MW. This pattern is similar to observations with polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene (PE), i.e., both \(M_{\mathrm{w}}\) and \(M_{\mathrm{v}}\) decreased after being fed low MW PP, while \(M_{\mathrm{w}}\) and/or \(M_{\mathrm{v}}\) increased after high MW PP was fed. The gut microbiota exhibited specific bacteria associations, such as *Kluyvera* sp. and *Pedicoccus* sp. for high MW PP degradation, *Acinetobacter* sp. for medium MW PP, and *Bacillus* sp. alongside three other bacteria for low MW PP metabolism. In the host transcriptome, digestive enzymes and plastic degradation-related bacterial enzymes were up-regulated after feeding on PP depending on different MWs. The *T. molitor* host exhibited both defensive function and degradation capability during the biodegradation of plastics, with high MW PP showing a relatively negative impact on the larvae.

## INTRODUCTION

Polypropylene (PP, \(\left(\mathrm{C}_{3} \mathrm{H}_{6}\right)_{n}\)) ranks as the second most widely used plastic, contributing to 18.9\% of global plastic production in 2022 \({ }^{1}\) and ranking as a major waste plastic following polyethylene (PE). \({ }^{2}\) The PP polymer is characterized by a high molecular weight (MW) (10-550 kDa) and long carbon chains, which hinder atmospheric oxidation and degradation. The accumulation of PP or other plastic wastes exerts adverse biological effects on various cell lines and human health. \({ }^{3}\)

As a nonhydrolyzed polyolefin plastic, \({ }^{4,5}\) the iso-paraffin structure with side chains \((- \mathrm{CH}_{3})\) in PP makes it more resistant to biodegradation compared to the linear \(n\)-paraffin in PE. To date, only a limited number of microorganisms have been reported to degrade PP, typically requiring pretreatment and exhibiting a slow degradation rate. \({ }^{6,7}\) Recent researchers have identified certain macroinvertebrates capable of biodegrading major plastics, \({ }^{8}\) such as insect larvae belonging to darkling beetles (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) including *Tenebrio molitor* (T. molitor), \({ }^{9-13}\) *Tenebrio obscurus, \({ }^{14}\) Zophobas atratus, \({ }^{15,16}\) Uloma sp., \({ }^{17}\) and *Plesiophthalmus davidis; \({ }^{18}\) pyralid moths (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) including *Plodia interpunctella, \({ }^{19,20}\) *Galleria mellonella, \({ }^{21-27}\) and *Achroia grisella; \({ }^{28}\) as well as other macroinvertebrates e.g., land snails *Achatina Fulica. \({ }^{29}\) Among these, *T. molitor* larvae have been extensively studied for their ability to degrade a wide range of materials, including wood residues in the environment, \({ }^{30}\) lignocellulosic agricultural residues, \({ }^{31,32}\) and various plastics including polystyrene (PS), \({ }^{7,9,31-35}\) low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE), \({ }^{12,15,36,37}\) polyvinyl chloride (PVC), \({ }^{15}\) polyethylene terephthalate (PET), \({ }^{38}\) polyurethane (PUR), \({ }^{39}\) polyactic acids (PLA), \({ }^{40}\) and even rubber \({ }^{41}\) and graphene oxide. \({ }^{42}\) Our previous study

The processes of plastic degradation depend on the polymer chemical and physical properties. \({ }^{5,33,44}\) Since a large amount of data regarding plastic properties have been measured along with changes in MW during the biodegradation of plastics, MW is considered a dominant property that impacts PP biodegradation. \({ }^{44}\) Peng et al. \({ }^{33}\) found that the gut microbiome and metabolome responded to PS polymers with a wide MW range from 6.70 to 1346 kDa. Yang et al. examined the biodegradation of LDPE microplastics (MPs) with \(M_{w}\) from 0.84 to 106.8 kDa and HDPE with \(M_{w}\) from 52 to 132.7 kDa, finding that PE with lower \(M_{w}\) underwent a greater extent of depolymerization. Furthermore, factors such as MW, PE type, branching, and crystallinity, significantly influence the larvae's biodegradation capabilities. \({ }^{37}\) These studies indicated that the MW of PS and PE impacts depolymerization patterns and microbiome development, but the impact on host gene expression was not reported.

Among commonly used plastics, PP exhibits the highest resistance to degradation. \({ }^{44}\) To date, the degradation mechanism of PP polymers in \(T\). molitor larvae remains largely unknown. Based on previous findings related to the biodegradation of PS and LDPE, \({ }^{33,37,45}\) we hypothesized that (a) a synergistic effect might exist between the insects and their microorganisms during PP degradation; (b) the insect's digestive function and its gut microbiota would be altered to facilitate their adaption to a plastic-rich diet; \({ }^{46,47}\) and (c) physical properties, especially MWs, significantly impact PP biodegradation influencing both the gut microbiome and host gene expression for enzyme synthesis. However, the response of \(T\). molitor larvae to different MW portions of PP has not yet been investigated. It is interesting to determine whether the MW of PP exhibited a similar or different impact on plastic depolymerization/biodegradation and the gut microbiome compared to other polyolefins by the larvae. Consequently, understanding the host gene expression response to various MWs of PP is crucial for elucidating the degradation mechanism of \(T\). molitor larvae.

The aim of this study was to explore the synergistic effect of the host digestive system and the diverse symbiotic gut microbes harbored within it on the biodegradation of PP polymers across a range of low to high MWs, which encompass the MW range of commercial products. This study was based on the three hypotheses mentioned above to investigate the knowledge regarding the factors affecting PP degradation, including the physical and chemical properties of PPs, host gene expression, and interactions among microbial species in \(T\). molitor larvae. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and transcriptome profiling were utilized to comprehend PP metabolism and energy supply by digesting the nutrient-limited PP polymer.

\section*{MATERIALS AND METHODS}

\section*{Mealworms and Feedstocks.} \(T\). molitor larvae (average weight: \(27 \pm 0.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{Larva}\); length: approximately \(1.5 \mathrm{~cm}\); instar: 4-5) were obtained from a breeding farm in Dezhou, China. Commercial PP MPs (10 \(\mu \mathrm{m})\) with a number-average molecular weight \(\left(M_{n}\right)\) of 26.59, a weight-average molecular weight \(\left(M_{w}\right)\) of 187.12, and a z-average molecular weight \(\left(M_{z}\right)\) of 731.6 kDa were purchased from Kexinda Plastic Factory (Shanghai, China). Five high-purity PP samples were acquired from American Polymer Standards Corporation, classified by their respective \(M_{w}\) of 0.83, 6.20, 50.40, 108.00, and 575.00 kDa, and designated as PP \(_{0.83}, \mathrm{PP}_{6.2}, \mathrm{PP}_{50.4}, \mathrm{PP}_{108}\), and \(\mathrm{PP}_{575}\) (Figure S1). \(\mathrm{PP}_{0.83}\) was in a viscous liquid form, and \(\mathrm{PP}_{6.2}\) was presented as a gel-like soft solid. \(\mathrm{PP}_{50.4}\) and \(\mathrm{PP}_{108}\) were nonuniform solid bulk materials, while \(\mathrm{PP}_{575}\) consisted of pellets measuring 2-4 mm. The three solid PP samples were ground under freezing conditions using a stainless-steel high-throughput tissue grinder (Wonbio-L, Shanghai Wonbio Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai) to reduce the particulate size to less than 75 \(\mu \mathrm{m}\) for testing. Agar was purchased from Beijing Aoboxing Biotech Co., Ltd. Wheat bran (WB) was procured from a breeding farm in Dezhou, Shandong, China.

\section*{Mealworm Rearing and Biodegradation of PP Polymers.} Prior to testing, the larvae were kept unfed for 24 h and then reared under controlled conditions (25 \({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, 60 \%\) relative humidity and dark conditions).

The commercial PP MPs, typically used for PP products with lower MW than the previously tested PP foam, \({ }^{43}\) were used to examine consumption and degradation of PP MPs with broad MW distribution. Each incubator \((16 \times 11 \times 5 \mathrm{~cm})\) contained 500 randomly selected larvae. PP polymers (5 g) were mixed with a boiled 2\% (w/w) agar solution (100 mL) and solidified as PP-agar gel (5:2, w/w) to feed the larvae. Control groups included larvae fed on agar gel and those left unfed.

The test to examine the effect of MW on PP degradation involved mixing each high-purity PP polymer (400 mg) with a 2\% (w/w) agar solution (Supporting Information M1). The experiment ended when the feedstocks were completely consumed, with all treatments conducted in triplicate \((n=3)\).

\section*{Collection of Frass and Analytical Methods.} At the end of the test, \(T\). molitor larvae were cleansed with compressed air to remove residual PP debris from the body and then transferred to a clean box for approximately 12 h to collect frass. The MW \(\left(M_{n}, M_{w}\right.\), and \(\left.M_{z}\right)\) of PP was determined using high-temperature gel permeation chromatography (HT-GPC). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance \(\left({ }^{1} \mathrm{H}\right.\) NMR) spectroscopy were conducted to characterize the polymer's functional groups, as detailed in SI M2. \({ }^{48}\) The polydispersity index (PDI) was calculated as \(\mathrm{PDI}=M_{w} / M_{n}\). The \({ }^{13} \mathrm{C}\) stable isotope signatures of the residual plastics from the frass, relative to the pristine PP plastics, expressed in delta \((\delta)\) notation in parts per thousand \(\left(\%_{c}\right)\), were calculated as outlined in SI M3

\[
\delta^{13} \mathrm{C}(\% c)=\left[\frac{\left({ }^{13} \mathrm{C} /{ }^{12} \mathrm{C}\right)_{\text {sample }}}{\left({ }^{13} \mathrm{C} /{ }^{12} \mathrm{C}\right)_{\text {standard }}}-1\right] \times 1000
\]

\section*{Gut Microbiome and Transcriptome Analyses.} At the end of the experiment, 20 larvae were randomly selected from each parallel group. The guts were extracted from these selected larvae and combined into one sample. This process was conducted in triplicate for the three parallel groups of each treatment. Second-generation sequencing was used to analyze changes in the gut microbiome and differences in transcriptome expression. High-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA was performed on the Illumina NovaSeq PE250 platform (Illumina NovaSeq PE250, Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) (SI M4). The sequencing data

\section*{■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION}

Consumption and Biodegradation of Commercial PP MPs with a Wide MW Distribution. The biodegradation of commercial PP MPs with a broad MW distribution (PDI = 7.04) was confirmed by T. molitor larvae. Over a 36 day period, the larvae actively chewed and ingested the PP gel (Figure S2a) and consumed 7 g of PP, resulting in an average mass reduction of 29.14\% and a specific removal rate of 13.72 mg 100 larvae \({ }^{-1} \mathrm{~d}^{-1}\) (Table 1). The survival rates (SRs) and weight change of the larvae fed with the commercial PP polymers plus agar were higher than those of the agar-fed larvae, much higher than those of the unfed larvae, and slightly lower than those fed with WB, as expected (Figure S2b,c, data in Table 1). This indicated that PP served as a source of energy and carbon for T. molitor larvae in addition to agar during the period of 36 days (SI R1). The lower SR and weight increase

The content of the image is a scientific paper about plastic degradation via mealworms. The paper discusses the impact of molecular weight (MW) on the consumption and biodegradation of polypropylene (PP) by Tenebrio molitor larvae. The paper includes several figures and tables that describe the results of experiments on the degradation of PP with different MWs.

Figure 1a shows the depolymerization pattern of the commercial PP MPs, which appears to show a limited extent of depolymerization (LD). The figure indicates that the depolymerization pattern of the PP MPs is similar to that observed in previous studies on mealworms biodegrading PP foam with a higher MW.

Figure 1b shows the biodegradation of PP by T. molitor larvae, which is a novel methodology based on isotopic fractionation utilizing the natural labeling of stable isotopes in the environment. The isotopic values for the pristine PP and the extracted residue PP from the larvae were -28.80 and -27.22%, respectively, with a Δδ13C of 1.58%. This indicates a 13C enrichment in the residual PP polymer following the passage of PP polymer through the larval gut.

Figure 1c shows the isotopic values for the pristine PP and the extracted residue PP from the larvae, with a Δδ13C of 1.58%. This indicates a 13C enrichment in the residual PP polymer following the passage of PP polymer through the larval gut.

Figure 1d-f shows the biodegradation of PP with different MWs by T. molitor larvae. The figure indicates that the biodegradability of PP with different MWs varies, with lower MW PP being more rapidly broken down than higher MW PP.

Figure 1g shows the GPC results for the biodegradation of PP with different MWs by T. molitor larvae. The figure indicates that the MW of all tested PP polymers shifted toward the lower MW direction, demonstrating that the larvae are capable of biodegrading PP across a broad MW range.

The paper concludes that stable isotope analysis offers an insightful approach to assessing the biodegradation of petroleum-derived plastics.

\section*{Gut Microbiome Analyses.} 16S rRNA sequencing was utilized to analyze changes in the gut microbial composition of \(T\). molitor larvae under different feeding conditions (five PP polymers with different MW and WB). Gut community richness and diversity declined with PP feeding (SI R3-1, Figure S6a,b). A PCA based on genera (Figure S6c) and a heatmap based on Euclidean distances (Figure S7) revealed that the gut microbiota of \(T\). molitor larvae fed with lower MW PP s were closer, and similarly, as did those fed with higher MW PP s. This indicated that the composition of intestinal microbes varied based on MW. Consequently, the PP-fed groups were categorized into three subgroups: PP-L (PP \(_{83}\) and PP \(_{63}\) ), PP-M (PP \(_{50,4}\) and PP \(_{108}\) ), and PP-H (PP \(_{575}\) ), to further analyze the contribution of gut microbiota to PP degradation.

Microbial community analysis at the genus level indicated a significant shift in gut microbiomes after PP was fed (Figure 2a), revealing the association of other polyolefin-degrading-related bacteria with PP degradation in the larval gut, despite the scarcity of microbes capable of biodegrading unpretreated PP as a sole carbon source. The dominant species in PP-L were Lachnatalea sp. (37.49\%), Hafnia-Obsumbacter sp. (13.16\%), and Klebsiella sp. (9.04\%); in PP-M, they were Lachnatalea sp. (33.88\%), Mixta sp. (14.79\%), and Cronobacter sp. (10.68\%); and in larvae fed with PP-H, they were Lachnatalea sp. (57.75\%), Klebsiella sp. (9.18\%), and Cronobacter sp. (7.74\%) in larvae fed with PP-H, respectively. Among these, Klebsiella sp., Cronobacter sp., and Mixta sp. are commonly reported genera associated with plastic degradation or nitrogen fixation in \(T\). molitor. \({ }^{37,55,56}\) A bacterium belonging to Klebsiella sp. (Klebsiella pneumoniae Mk-1) has been isolated from soil and confirmed to degrade PE. \({ }^{57}\) Lachnatalea sp. was isolated from a lignocellulose-rich microbial community and shows potential for degrading natural organic polymer. \({ }^{58}\) Hafnia-Obsumbacter sp. has been reported to be associated with PET degradation in \(T\). molitor \({ }^{38}\) and PS degradation in \(Z\). atratus. \({ }^{59}\) However, further research is needed to investigate their ability to degrade PP.

Correlation network analysis of the top 50 bacteria revealed distinct keystone species recognized for the biodegradation of low-, medium-, to high MW PP (Figure 2b). PP-L mastication resulted in the enrichment of Bacillus sp. (0.11\%), Clostridiales Family XIV. Incertae Sedis unclassified (0.14\%), Lachnospiraceae unclassified (0.05\%), and Virgibacillus sp. (0.05\%) in \(T\). molitor larvae. These species were possibly associated and/or involved in PP degradation in the gut of \(T\). molitor larvae, albeit with low abundance (<1\%). A detailed discussion of their role can be found in SI R3-2. Correlation network analysis that included WB is also exhibited in Figure S8 and discussed in SI R3-3.

Acinetobacter sp. (0.71\%) was enriched in the gut of PP-M-fed larvae as a potential candidate for the degradation of PP-M. Although Acinetobacter sp. has not been identified in PP degradation, it has been strongly associated with LDPE and PS biodegradation in \(T\). molitor and \(G\). mellonella larvae. \({ }^{60-63}\) This genus encompasses strictly aerobic species capable of oxidizing and depolymerizing PP carbon chains.

Kluyvera sp. (0.36\%) and Pediococcus sp. (0.11\%) were highly correlated in larvae fed with PP-H, suggesting their strong association with high MW PP degradation. In our previous study of the biodegradation of PP foam (Mw 356.00 kDa) by \(T\). molitor, Kluyvera sp. associated with PP-H biodegradation was identified. \({ }^{43}\) The PP foam had a relatively high MW, albeit slightly lower than that of the PP-H in this study \(\left(M_{w}=750.00 \mathrm{kDa}\right)\). Pediococcus sp., previously found to be associated with the production of organic acids from water-soluble carbohydrates during the fermentation of whole-plant corn silage, \({ }^{54}\) showed a high correlation with PP \(_{575}\). This suggests that this genus may utilize the intermediates of PP degradation as substrates.

The 16S rRNA data suggested that different bacteria could synergistically degrade PP in the larval gut, akin to the cooperation observed between Acinetobacter NyZ450 and Bacillus spp. NyZ451 for the biodegradation of a PE mulching film. \({ }^{51}\) Specific bacterial dominance was observed in larvae fed with different MW PPs, with cooperative interactions hinted at for the utilization of PP degradation intermediates. Notably, some of the key microorganisms involved in the degradation of different MW PP were also identified as key microorganisms in lignocellulose degradation, \({ }^{31,64-66}\) such as Bacillus sp., Spiroplasma sp., Pediococcus sp., and Enterococcus sp. This suggests that the ability of \(T\). molitor to degrade PP can be traced back to its ability to degrade natural lignocellulosic polymers. \({ }^{31,32,67}\)

\section*{Functional Prediction of the Gut Microbial Communities.} Functional prediction by PICRUSt analysis revealed a higher abundance of specific enzymes, i.e., alkane-1-monoxygenase, carboxylesterase, cutinase, and dehydrogenase in PP-fed larvae compared to those fed with WB (control) (Figure 3a-f). This indicates their potential functions in plastic degradation.

Among the top 20 KEGG pathways, metabolic pathways were the most enriched (Figure 3g). The gene expression of gut microbiota in the PP-M and WB groups was similar and lower than that in the PP-L and PP-H groups. Specifically, larvae fed on different PPs showed up-regulation in genes related to the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, microbial metabolism in diverse environments, biosynthesis of amino acid metabolism, and carbon metabolism compared to the WB control. Rather, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter pathways were highly expressed in the larvae fed on distinct MW of PP, facilitating intracellular importation of intermediate products following the extracellular depolymerization of PP in bacteria, as previously reported. \({ }^{68}\) These observations indicate the assimilation of PP intermediates via cellular carbon metabolism by the microbiota. Notably, pathways related to chemotaxis, such as two-component system, quorum sensing, bacterial chemotaxis, and flagellar assembly, were enriched in PP-fed microbiota, similar to the degradation of aromatic-aliphatic copolyester plastic by a marine microbial consortium. \({ }^{69}\) These functions aid in bacterial community colonization, motility, and the transfer of electrons to electron acceptors outside bacterial cells. The phenomenon of quorum sensing suggests coordination among various gut microbes during PP degradation. The nitrogen metabolism pathway (KO00910) was enriched in PP-fed groups (Figure S9), indicating that, besides the plastic degradation, nitrogen fixation was also performed by intestinal bacteria when the larvae received a nitrogen-deficient diet of PP as a food source. As observed, many insects that feed on a low-nitrogen diet (such as wood-feeding beetles, fruit flies, termites, and a wood wasp) rely on nitrogen-fixing bacteria (diazotrophs) to supplement their nitrogen supply. \({ }^{70}\) Recently, evidence for nitrogen fixation has been found during the degradation of PS, LDPE, and PET by \(T\). molitor larvae. \({ }^{38,46,71}\)

The analysis of gut microbial communities showed that various microorganisms in \(T\). molitor larvae degrade polymers with different MW of PP polymers, yet the main functions of intestinal microorganisms in the process of plastic degradation are unified. This finding implies that the intestinal microbial community of \(T\). molitor larvae contributes to PP biodegradation by forming a system conducive to plastic degradation domesticated through ingesting polymers. Specifically, after plastics enter the digestive tract, gut microorganisms utilize chemotaxis-related pathways (such as two-component systems, quorum sensing, bacterial chemotaxis, and flagellar assembly) to navigate toward PPs, aiding in the establishment and movement of bacterial communities. Through enzymes secreted collaboratively by gut microorganisms and the larval host, polymers are initially degraded. Intermediate products are then transported into microbial cells via transport systems for further metabolism.

\section*{Host Transcriptome Response to PP Polymers.} To reflect the function of the \(T\). molitor larval host during in vivo degradation of PP, changes in gene expression in the intestines were evaluated via the host transcriptome. PCA (Figure S10a) and Spearman correlation (Figure S10b) analyses revealed clusters associated with different diets (PP-L, PP-M, PP-H, and WB), indicating that the larvae developed distinct host gene expression during the biodegradation of PP polymers with three different MW groups.

Compared to WB-fed larvae, there were a total of 296, 820, 451, 714, and 430 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) up-regulated, and 218, 372, 174, 297, and 410 DEGs down-regulated in the larvae fed with PP \(_{0.83}, \mathrm{PP}_{6.2}, \mathrm{PP}_{50.4}, \mathrm{PP}_{108}\), and \(\mathrm{PP}_{575}\), respectively (Figure 4a). The \(\mathrm{PP}_{575}\) with the largest

of its own fat and digestion of agar and self-cannibalism products due to nutrient deficiency.

Specifically, in addition to the DEGs with the highest p-values, known polyolefin degradation oxidases, \({ }^{82}\) including various monoxygenase (GEV33-009675, gene-GEV33-005371, gene-GEV33-014143, gene-GEV33-006993, gene-GEV33-013368, gene-GEV33-009986, gene-GEV33-001449, gene-GEV33-001856), laccase (GEV33-001044), and peroxidase (gene-GEV33-002024, gene-GEV33-013532), showed substantial enrichment in the PP-fed groups compared to the control group. This finding indicates that the host can produce these three types of oxidases for PP oxidation.

The above observations indicate that \(T\). molitor host possesses both defensive functions and degradation capabilities toward plastics. Compared to the WB-fed group, larvae fed PP ranging from low- to high MW demonstrated up-regulation of genes associated with innate digestive enzymes and plastic degradation-related enzymes. Genes encoding other functions such as MRPs and signal transduction represent an adaptive response to nutrient-deficient conditions induced by PP diets. When the MW reached a high level (i.e., PP575), the most down-regulated genes were observed among the five MWs of PP-fed samples (Figure 4a), indicating a potential depression of certain bodily functions due to the deteriorated biodegradability of high MW PP.

Plausible Biodegradation Mechanisms of PP Polymers. The metabolic pathways of PP are complicated and could be influenced by many factors, including multiple enzymes secreted by both gut microbiota and the host. Based on the results of this study, hydroxylation or carboxylation, which are crucial for activating the inert C-C bond in the PP backbone for scission, poses a challenging task for a single strain to carry out. The results of the present study point to a dual contribution from the host and gut microbiota in the biodegradation of PP from low to high MW. Within the larval gut, multiple enzymes, as well as bioemulsifying factors \({ }^{47}\) secreted by the host and microbes, accelerate the biodegradation of plastics such as PP. Combining the results from previous reports \({ }^{43}\) and our study, we hypothesize plausible PP biodegradation pathways as follows. Initially, the host larvae defragment PP particles by chewing and ingesting them. Digestive enzymes secreted by the larvae and gut bacteria move around the plastic particles and attach to the surface of polymers with the help of bioemulsifying factors. The initial depolymerization of nonhydrolyzable PP is performed by multiple extracellular enzymes secreted from the bacteria and the host (e.g., monoxygenase, laccase, and peroxidase) to attack and oxidize the PP polymer, resulting in the formation of oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface and chain breaking. This alteration renders the surface hydrophilic, allowing for further disintegration and fragmentation of PP particles into short chains or small molecules. Transmembrane proteins then transport these molecules into the microbial cells to enter diverse metabolic pathways for the complete metabolism. During this process, gut microbes utilize different MW fractions of PP and fix ingested nitrogen gas for the synthesis of proteins needed by the larvae and gut microbiota. The host exhibited a dietary adaptive regulatory mechanism to survive and reproduce in environments with nutrient restrictions. The host activates MRPs, transporters involved in the efflux of plastics within cells, reducing the metabolic pressure exerted on the plastics. The host also activates plastic-biodegradation-related pathways to accelerate PP degradation and metabolism, thus receiving energy and carbon sources for their living activities.

Environmental Implications. This is the first report to confirm the inherent capability of \(T\). molitor larvae to biodegrade PP polymers spanning from low to high MWs, ranging from \(M_{w}\) of 0.83 to 575.00 kDa. This indicates that most commercial PP products \(\left(M_{w}\right.\) from 120.00 to 550.00 kDa) could be biodegraded by the larvae. The polymer MW affects depolymerization patterns and the degradation process. The PP biodegradation can be effectively accessed by determining the \(\Delta \delta^{13} \mathrm{C}\) of the PP polymers before and after biodegradation.

The results reveal that the larvae altered gene expression of both gut bacteria and host to form a system conducive to plastic degradation when they received PP diets, contingent on PP MWs for utilizing them as a carbon source and adapting to nutritional stress. The larval gut functions as an effective bioreactor, activating innate digestive enzymes, oxidases, defensive functions, signal transduction functions, and carbohydrate transport and metabolism-related functions for synergistic PP degradation. This explains why in vitro biodegradation of plastics like PP, PS, and PE by gut bacterial strains isolated from the \(T\). molitor and other plastic-degrading larvae is much less efficient than in vivo biodegradation. These findings offer new dimensions for understanding the biodegradation process of polyolefins in \(T\). molitor larvae, providing a theoretical basis for strengthening plastic degradation by harnessing the physiological characteristics of plastic-eating insects. Additionally, the findings that different predominant bacteria are responsible for biodegrading PP with different MWs provide information on the selection of targeted microbes and enzymes for distinct types of PP waste. However, besides MW, the physical properties of the polymer such as particle size will also affect its biodegradation, and further experiments are needed to investigate it.
