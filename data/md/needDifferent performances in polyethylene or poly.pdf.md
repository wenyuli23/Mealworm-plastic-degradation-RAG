### Abstract
The biodegradation of plastics by insect larvae is considered as an emerging strategy for the resistant plastic wastes disposal. To uncover the correlation of insect larval gut-microbiome with plastics biodegradation, two worm species including superworm Zophobas atratus and yellow mealworm Tenebrio molitor were fed with either polyethylene (PE) or polystyrene (PS) foam as sole diet for a longer period of 45 days, sole bran diet was used as control. Rapid declines of survival rates and plastic ingestions after 30 days were observed, suggesting that long-term sole plastic diet was detrimental to growth and life cycle completion in both larval species. Both PE and PS plastics were found more extensively depolymerized and biodegraded in gut of yellow mealworms than that of superworms by GPC analysis. The larval gut bacterial- and fungal-microbiomes at day 45 were assessed by Illumina MiSeq. The results showed that both gut bacterial and fungal communities shifted upon sole plastic diet ingestion compared to the control. Gut bacterial communities were similar in PS-fed groups but significantly different in PE-fed groups between both species. In contrast, gut fungal communities were clustered by species in general, although they were similar between PE- and PS-fed yellow mealworms but were more divergent between PE- and PE-fed superworms. Analysis of the changes of relative abundances of dominant bacterial and fungal genera demonstrated the strong association between the distinctive gut microbiome and plastic degradation. For instance, *Spiroplasma* and *Rhodotorula* for PE degradation, *Cryptococcus* for PS degradation in mealworms. *Issatchenkia* for both PS and PE degradation, *Pseudomonas* for PS degradation in superworms. In conclusion, changes of both gut bacterial- and fungal-microbiomes diversities were associated with plastic feedstock types and larval species, especially fungal microbiomes were strongly associated with larval species.

## 1. Introduction

Plastics, such as polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), polyurethane (PU), and polypropylene (PP), are widely used in our daily life, including chemical instrument parts, transparent films, and pipes. In 2019, the global plastic production reached 368 million tons with an increase of nearly 10 million tons compared to the year 2018 [27]. The global plastic waste emissions increased exponentially, but only 10% of plastic waste was recycled [34]. Plastic wastes have become one of the top global environmental concerns due to the ever-increasing accumulation in environment as a result of plastics' mass production and recalcitrance to degradation [14]. The inherent characteristics of plastic polymers, including high molecular weight and high crystallinity, hinder their disintegration and lead to their accumulation in natural environment [1,31]. Accumulation of plastic waste not only affects environmental aesthetic quality but also poses substantial threats to the health and survival of wildlife and human beings [6,18]. Therefore, scientists have been advocating for limiting the use of plastic as well as exploring the ways to effectively degrade plastics.

The discoveries of ingestion and degradation of plastic by insect


larvae provided a new research direction for plastic biodegradation. In current investigations, larvae of six insect species have been found capable of plastic ingestion and degradation, including superworm Zophobas atratus [19,26], yellow mealworm Tenebrio molitor [4,25,44], dark mealworm Tenebrio obscurus [25], greater waxworm Galleria mellonella [2], lesser waxworm Achroia grisella [16], and Indian-meal moths Plodia interpunctella [39]. A variety of analytical methods, such as gel permeation chromatography (GPC) [41,44], attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) [19,30] and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) [19,25], have been employed to identify the changes of the molecular weights, functional groups, and the associated thermal stabilities of plastics. Results from these studies confirmed the degradation of plastic in the larval gut and revealed the changes of larval gut bacterial communities with sole plastic diets. For instance, Citrobacter was associated with PE and PP diets in superworms [19,40] and strongly associated with both PE and PS diets in mealworms [3]. Sphingobacterium and Dysgonomonas were associated with PS diet in superworms [19], while Klebsiella was in mealworms [4]. Enterobacter was associated with PP diet in superworms, while Kluyvera in mealworms [40]. Mangrovibacter was related to PU diet in superworms [19]. In contrast to the frequent reports on the larval gut bacteria association with plastic degradation, associations between fungi and plastics degradation in larval guts were rarely reported. There is only one report about the involvement of Aspergillus, Hypodermaella, and Trichoderma in PS plastic degradation in mealworm guts [7]. Therefore, it is necessary to explore changes of gut fungal communities to reveal their associations with plastic diets.

We hypothesize that the original gut microbial (including bacteria and fungi) communities are different in different worm species, but key OTUs strongly associated with plastic degradation depend on the type of plastics. To test this hypothesis, larvae of superworm Z. atratus and yellow mealworm T. molitor were fed with PS or PE foam plastics as sole diets with sole bran feeding as controls under the same conditions for 45 days. Analysis of frass samples by ATR-FTIR, TGA and GPC confirmed the degradation of plastics in worm guts. Amplicon sequencing results of 16S rRNA and ITS gene with Illumina MiSeq demonstrated the changes of gut bacterial and fungal microbiome diversities with sole plastic diet. The results indicated that the larval plastic ingestion preferences and efficiencies were strongly associated with larval species. Changes of microbial communities were more complex than we hypothesized. Bacterial community diversities decreased, but fungal community diversities increased. In terms of overall similarities of gut microbiomes, for bacterial community, PS-fed groups had the highest similarities, PE-fed group had the least similarities, and the control group had the intermediate similarities. In contrast, for fungal communities, control groups had the highest similarities, plastic-fed superworm groups had the least similarities, and plastic-fed mealworm groups had the intermediate similarities. The results suggest that plastic type is an important factor for bacterial community change while worm species is an important factor for fungal community changes under sole plastic diet.

\section*{2. Materials and methods}

\subsection*{2.1. Larvae and feedstocks}

Superworms and yellow mealworms larvae were purchased from Wuxi Insects Breeding Plant, Jiangsu, China. Superworm larvae were approximately \(5.00 \pm 0.25 \mathrm{~cm}\) in length and \(613.36 \pm 19.55 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{larva}\) in weight. Mealworm larvae were approximately \(1.48 \pm 0.12 \mathrm{~cm}\) in length and \(58.28 \pm 2.34 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{larva}\) in weight. Wheat bran was purchased from the specialty stores and used as the feedstock for control groups. Foam plastics of PE (low density polyethylene, LDPE, \(0.010 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}\) ) and PS (highly expanded polystyrene, \(0.009 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}\) ) were purchased from Yinlong Plastic Company (Zhejiang, China) and used as experimental feedstocks, no plastic was replaced during the experiment. The bran was natural without any additives. Larvae were fed with bran and starved for 72 h before initiation of the experimental diets.

\subsection*{2.2. Larval growth and plastics consumption}

A total of six groups of larvae were included in the experiment, including three groups of bran-, PE-, or PS-fed superworms, and three groups of bran-, PE-, or PS-fed yellow mealworms, with three replicates in each group. Bran-fed groups were used as controls. For each group, randomly selected 20 superworms or 100 yellow mealworms were incubated in a container \((15 \times 10 \times 7 \mathrm{~cm})\) to maintain the convenient density for good larval growth [28]. All groups were kept under the controlled condition of \(25 \pm 1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, 60 \pm 5 \%\) humidity, and dark environment [19,45] for 45 days. Before the experiment, the PE and PS foam plastics were cut into pieces with sizes of \(8 \times 5 \times 2 \mathrm{~cm}\), cleaned with distilled water, and dried at \(30{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) for 2 days. At the beginning of the experiment, 5 g bran was added in the control groups, and additional 5 g bran was supplemented every 5 days. One piece of PE or PS foam plastic \((\mathrm{PE}=800 \pm 16 \mathrm{mg} ; \mathrm{PS}=720 \pm 12 \mathrm{mg})\) was added in each plastic diet group as sole feedstock for 45 days. Dead larvae and molting exoskeleton were removed immediately via daily checking. Weights of plastic and larvae were measured every 5 days. Larval survival rates, accumulative net weight changes, and cumulative foam consumptions were calculated at 5-day intervals by comparing to the amounts or weights at the beginning of the experiment.

\subsection*{2.3. Collection and characterization of frass samples}

Collection and analysis of the residual polymers in the larval frass were performed as described previously [19]. Briefly, the frass samples were collected at a 5-day interval. Larvae were transferred to new containers before collecting the frass to avoid carryover of the un-ingested plastic in frass. The frass was collected pellet by pellet using forceps and stored in aseptic tubes at \(-20{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) till further analysis.

Major functional groups in frass were characterized by an ATR-FTIR (vertex70, Brock instruments, Germany) with wavenumbers ranging from 4000 to \(400 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}\) and compared to the original PE or PS feedstocks [30]. To further demonstrate the degradation of plastic in larval frass, frass pellets were dissolved in water, vortexed and centrifuged at 6000 rpm. After centrifugation, the floating plastic on the water surface and the pellets at the bottom of tubes were collected separately and stored at \(-20{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\). The residual plastics in the frass was observed by optical microscope (BX53, U-HGLGPS, Olympus, Japan) and scanning electron microscope (SEM, Apreo 2 C, Thermo Scientific, Inc., USA), and then analyzed respectively by the ATR-FTIR and GPC. The frozen samples were thawed and air-dried in a \(40{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) incubator for \(5 \mathrm{~h}\) before the ATR-FTIR analysis. Peak values were analyzed with the OMNIC software and confirmed based on the best expert judgment by the presence of specific absorption bands in accordance with literatures [15,19], the process for SEM observation was described in Method S1 in Supporting Information.

Thermal gravimetric analysis (SDT Q600, TA Instruments, USA) was conducted to characterize the thermal changes of plastic polymers in frass pellets of plastic-fed superworms or yellow mealworms. The sample was heated from \(40{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) to \(800{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) at a rate of \(20{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C} / \mathrm{min}\) under a high-purity argon

The survival rates of each group during the 45-day experiment were calculated and shown in Fig. 1a. At the end of the experiment, for superworm groups, the bran-fed control group had a survival rate of 100%, the PS-fed groups had intermediate survival rate of 78.33 ± 5.67%, and the PE-fed groups had the lowest survival rate of 68.33 ± 2.88%. Similar trends but generally lower survival rates were observed for mealworm groups, the survival rates for the bran-fed control groups, the PS-fed groups, and the PE-fed groups were 90.67 ± 3.21%, 67.97 ± 2.92%, and 60.66 ± 7.08%, respectively. Comparing to previous studies with 35 days of plastic feeding, the survival rates of both larvae species in this study were lower ([26]; Luo et al., 2020; [18]), indicating that long-term plastic diet negatively affected growth and survival of both superworms and yellow mealworms. Similar trends of survival rates in both types of worms, namely bran-fed > PS-fed > PE-fed, demonstrated the adverse effects of sole plastics diets on the survival of both larvae species. Superworms had higher survival rates than yellow mealworms, possibly due to their higher vitality and resistance to hunger and thirst [26].

In terms of pupation, there were no significant differences between different diets in superworms, but significant differences in yellow mealworms. For superworms, totally two pupae were observed in PS-fed group on the 30th and the 40th day, respectively, one pupa was found in PE-fed group on the 30th day, but no pupa was found in the bran-fed control groups. For yellow mealworms, 50 larvae in bran-fed group pupated, but none in plastic-fed groups. The few pupations in superworms were probably due to their longer life time of 260–300 days in comparison to yellow mealworms of 90–100 days [20,33]. Therefore, we could not conclude that the pupation of superworms was negatively affected by plastic diets. In contrast, the significantly decreased pupation rates in plastic-fed mealworm groups indicated the adverse effects of sole plastic diets on growth and development.

The average accumulative net weight changes in each group were shown in Fig. 1b. In bran-fed groups, the average net weight changes of superworms and yellow mealworms continuously increased by 138.10 ± 16.85 and 108.95 ± 6.86 mg/larva during the 45-day experiment, respectively. The accumulative net weight changes in plastic-fed superworm groups continuously decreased after the initial increases in the first 5 days, suggesting that sole plastic diet could not provide sufficient nutrition to support their growth and development. In contrast, comparing to the bran-fed control group, the accumulative net weight changes of plastic-fed yellow mealworms showed slight increases during the experiment with similar net weight gains of 35.90 ± 0.15 and 35.38 ± 1.04 mg/larva in PS-fed and PE-fed mealworm groups, respectively. Overall, significant weight loss was observed in plastic-fed superworms, while yellow mealworms had a slight increase in body weight change, similar to the results in previous studies (Luo et al., 2020; [37]).

Plastic consumption rates over the 45-day-experiment were shown in Fig. 2. When calculated as mg plastic/larva, the cumulative foam plastics consumption rates were 26.98 ± 1.43 mg PS/larva and 13.56 ± 2.66 mg PE/larva by superworm, 2.51 ± 0.15 mg PS/larva and 2.10 ± 0.53 mg PE/larva by yellow mealworm. Plastic consumption rates by superworms were approximately 11 folds (p < 0.01) for PS and 6 folds (p < 0.05) for PE comparing to yellow mealworms, respectively, indicating that superworms had much higher plastic consumption rates

\label{fig:figure2}
\end{figure}

(Fig. 2a). To eliminate the effect of body size difference between two species, foam consumption efficiencies were also calculated as total plastic mass loss per initial larvae average weight. PS foam consumption rates were \( 43.70 \pm 2.13 \, \text{mg/g} \) superworms and \( 39.08 \pm 0.99 \, \text{mg/g} \) yellow mealworms, respectively (Fig. 2b). PE foam consumption rates were \( 21.20 \pm 3.58 \, \text{mg/g} \) superworms and \( 36.20 \pm 0.51 \, \text{mg/g} \) yellow mealworms, respectively (Fig. 2b). There was significant difference between the consumption rates of PE and PS by superworms (\( p < 0.01 \)), while no significant difference between the consumption rates of PE and PS by yellow mealworms (\( p < 0.05 \)). The difference of consumption rates suggested that the preference and consumption efficiency of plastics by both species were different. Unlike the 30- or 35-day-tests in literatures [18,19,26], the feeding time was extended to 45 days in this study. Although the plastic consumption efficiencies fluctuated slightly during the experiment, there was an overall downward trend (Fig. 2c \& 2d), especially in the last 10 days (35 \(\sim\) 45 d), which was consistent with the rapidly decreased survival rates in the last 10 d. Therefore, the results indicated that foam plastic cannot be used as sole and long-term feedstocks for both larvae species due to the adverse effects on larval growth, pupation, and completion of life. Amendment of certain amounts of nutrients such as bran could ameliorate the situation and promote sustained plastic consumption by these worms.

\subsection*{3.2. Degradation and oxidation of plastics}

Evidence for oxidation and de-polymerization of PS and PE by both larvae species were obtained and confirmed with ATR-FTIR analysis (Fig. 3, Tables S1 and S2). The ATR-FTIR spectra of the original plastic feedstocks and frass samples of plastics-fed larvae were shown in Fig. 3a and b. For PE-fed groups (Fig. 3a), the appearance of peaks at \( 1666 \, \text{cm}^{-1} \) (C\(=\)O stretch) and the significant decrease of peak intensity at \( 2910 \, \text{cm}^{-1} \) (–CH2 stretch) were observed, suggesting the occurrence of certain level of oxidation and de-polymerization of PE in larval guts of both species. For PS-fed groups (Fig. 3b), the appearance of peaks at 1635 and 1640 cm\(^{-1}\) (C\(=\)O stretch) and the disappearance of characteristic peaks of PS benzene ring skeleton vibrate (703 and 744 cm\(^{-1}\) ) were observed, indicating the oxidation and depolymerization and the cleavage of benzene ring of PS occurred in larval guts of both species. Similar to previous reports [3,26], the oxidation of PS and PE occurred in the range of 1700–1100 cm\(^{-1}\), that new functional groups of C\(=\)O stretch (1645–1675 cm\(^{-1}\) ) and C\(=\)O stretch (1075–1185 cm\(^{-1}\) ) were detected in the frass from PS- and PE-fed groups. The addition of oxygen functional groups into the polymer chain was considered as the preliminary and key step in plastic degradation [13,32]. The broad peaks at about 3370 cm\(^{-1}\) were assigned to hydroxyl or carboxylic acid groups, suggesting a change of hydrophobic to more hydrophilic surface [25]. The ATR-FTIR results indicated the occurrence of oxidation and degradation of PS and PE plastic after passing through larval guts of both species.

To avoid the interference of larval fat or protein in the frass, the floating portion of frass samples containing partially degraded plastic in the upper layer after centrifugation was observed and analyzed by optical microscope, SEM, ATR-FTIR and GPC, respectively. As shown in Fig. S1, the frass pellets of superworms were larger than that of yellow mealworms, which possibly due to the larger body size and larger mouthparts of superworms than yellow mealworms, and also resulting in larger debris in the frass (shown in Fig. S2). In addition, the frass pellets of PS-fed both larvae species were fluffier than that of PE-fed, which was suggested due to the different polymeric structure of two plastic types, as PE foam was a laminated structure and easier be


\begin{figure}[h]

Z = Z. atratus; T = T. molitor; PE = polyethylene foam; PS = polystyrene foam.}
\label{fig3}
\end{figure}

The SEM was used to further compare the morphological differences among original foam plastics, frass of plastics-fed larvae and floating plastics from frass (Fig. S3). Comparing to PE-fed frass and floating PE from frass, PS had a larger bulkiness and showed a clear mass structure with many holes, whereas PE showed a torn sheet shape. Compared to original foam plastics, pits and cracks were observed in the floating plastics and the pellets, demonstrating the degradation of PE and PS plastics did occur. For floating plastic groups (Fig. 3c and d), the characteristic peaks of PE (–CH2 stretch) at 2910 cm\(^{-1}\) and PS (benzene ring skeleton vibrate) at 703 and 744 cm\(^{-1}\) were slightly weaker than the original foam plastic, indicating partial depolymerization and oxidation of floating plastic in guts of both superworms and yellow mealworms. For bottom sedimentation groups (Fig. S4), partial degradation substances or degradation intermediates were probably present, but it was difficult to conduct in-depth analysis to determine the origin of various peaks due to the complexity of precipitates. Overall, the ATR-FITR analysis of frass, floating plastic and bottom sedimentation demonstrated that oxidation and biodegradation of PE and PS foam plastic did occur.

Thermal stabilities of foam plastic and frass samples were examined using DSC-TGA (Fig. 4a and b). The weight loss occurred and accelerated at temperature range of 400–500 \textdegree C. The reduction in the rate of weight loss indicated the emergence of new substances in the frass, such as inorganic substances, partially degraded plastics, and other biodegradation byproducts [26]. The decomposed parts at temperature ranges of 100–370 \textdegree C might be contributed by other biological digestive products [40], including cannibalism and plastic biodegradation residues from the guts. For PE-fed superworm frass, the weight loss of about 88.50\% occurred and accelerated at temperature range of 400–503 \textdegree C. Only two DSC curves in PE-fed frass sample were observed at 122.24 \textdegree C and 483.21 \textdegree C, which were similar to the endothermic peaks of the original PE plastic, indicating that PE was relatively thermally stable, and the degree of PE degradation by superworms was relatively lower. For PE-fed yellow mealworm frass, the weight loss of about 57.07\% was much lower than the control PE foam plastic of 99.02\%, indicating that the frass contained not only residual PE polymer but also new biodegraded products [42]. The DSC-TGA results confirmed that PE had undergone more obvious modification and degradation in yellow mealworm guts. For PS-fed groups, the weight losses of about 87.65\% in superworm frass and 72.78\% in yellow mealworm frass were much lower than that of PS foam plastic (98.15\%), and the DSC curves of both larvae species were similar. Overall, the DSC-TGA results suggested that the plastic components were degraded after passing through the larval gut.

The molecular weights of the ingested plastic polymers decreased significantly based on GPC analysis of the original foams and frass of plastics-fed larvae (Fig. 4c and d). For PE-fed groups, the number average weights (M\(_n\) ) decreased by 26.18\% and 30.67\%, respectively (original 35.2 \pm 1.8 vs. superworms frass 26.0 \pm 2.6, yellow mealworms frass 24.4 \pm 3.7 kDa), the weight average weights (M\(_w\) ) decreased by 20.40\% and 50.01\%, respectively (original 103.2 \pm 2.5 vs. superworms frass 82.2 \pm 2.6, yellow mealworms frass 51.6 \pm 2.7 kDa). For PS-fed groups, M\(_n\) decreased by 32.80\% and 36.19\%, respectively (original 125.2 \pm 1.5 vs. superworms frass 84.1 \pm 2.0, yellow mealworms frass 79.9 \pm 2.8 kDa), and M\(_w\) decreased by 23.19\% and 27.52\%, respectively (original 234.9 \pm 2.5 vs. superworms frass 180.4 \pm 2.0, yellow mealworms frass 170.3 \pm 1.9 kDa). The results confirmed that PE and PS foams were biodegraded via broad depolymerization in superworms and yellow mealworms as previous reported (Yang et al., 2018; [3,18]; Wu \& Criddle 2021). The GPC analysis of the floating

\end{figure}

plastics from the frass samples showed similar results (Results and Discussions S1 in the Supplementary). Interestingly, significant decreases of M_n and M_w were more severe in yellow mealworms than that in superworms, suggesting that the plastic depolymerization and biodegradation was more significant in gut of yellow mealworms, which was in contrast to the higher cumulative plastics consumption in superworms than yellow mealworms.

\subsection*{3.3. Response of gut-bacterial microbiome}

Illumina Miseq of the 16S rRNA gene was used to investigate the effect of plastic diets on the bacterial community. The Illumina MiSeq sequences of gut bacterial microbiome were deposited in the GenBank (accession numbers: SRR21384725, SRR21384726, SRR21384727, SRR21384728, SRR21517859 and SRR21517861). A total of 368,287 sequences were obtained with an average of 61381, and the sampling coverages were above 99\%, suggesting that the sequencing result was capable of detecting most of the reads (Table S3). The gut-bacterial community analysis results demonstrate the significant changes of bacteria communities in guts of both species with sole PE or PS diets compared to the control bran diet. Gut bacterial species richness and diversity estimators including OTUs, Chao, Shannon, Simpson, ACE and Coverage were summarized in Table S4. The OTU numbers of bran-fed control groups were similar with 186 in superworms and 180 in yellow mealworms, decreased significantly in plastic-fed groups with 56 in PE-fed superworms and 112 in PS-fed superworms, 88 in PE-fed yellow mealworms and 172 in PS-fed yellow mealworms. The results indicated that feeding plastic significantly reduced gut bacterial community diversity (Fig. S5a). Shannon and Simpson indices also indicated that bacterial richness significantly decreased in both superworms and yellow mealworms with sole plastic diet, especially PE-fed group (Table S4). The greater changes of OTUs in plastic-fed superworms indicated that the gut bacteria in superworms were more sensitive to the plastic sole diet than that of yellow mealworms. The OTU numbers of plastics-fed groups significantly decreased, similar to the change of gut bacterial community diversity in the PE degradation [17]. As feedstocks of complex polymers like PS and PE are hard to be utilized for most of bacteria, bacteria species lack of the plastic degradation pathway genes might not survive, leading to the lower bacterial OTUs number in the plastics-fed larval gut.

The NMDS based on Unweighted Unifrac and heatmap based on Bray-Curtis distances revealed clusters associated with the different larval species and diets (Fig. 5a and b). The gut bacterial communities were similar in the control bran-fed groups and PS-fed groups in both species, which was consistent with the more efficient ingestion of PS foam by both larvae species. In contrast, the gut bacterial communities of PE-fed groups were significantly different between two larvae species, which was consistent with the different PE consumption preferences (Fig. 2a) and might contribute to the different appearance of the guts (Fig. S6). In conclusion, changes of larval gut bacterial community were shaped by not only the type of feedstocks, but also larval species.

At phylum level, an analysis of the microbial community compositions revealed that Proteobacteria, Tenericutes and Firmicutes were the dominant phyla (Fig. 5c). Abundances of Proteobacteria were significantly higher in PS-fed superworms and yellow mealworms as well as PE-fed superworms, compared to bran-fed controls. Proteobacteria was also the predominant phyla associated with PS feeding in lesser mealworms Alphitobius diaperinus and yellow mealworms T. molitor larvae [7, 28] and PE feeding in greater waxworms G. mellonella [17]. Firmicutes was the dominant phyla in PE-fed superworms, Tenericutes was the dominated phyla in PE-fed yellow mealworms.

Changes of the relative abundances of the top 15 abundant genera

In PS-fed superworms, the dominant genera were unclassified Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, and Lactococcus, with relative abundances of 30.75%, 21.82%, and 15.54%, respectively. Associations of Pseudomonas with PS degradation in superworms [29], yellow mealworms [35] and greater wax moth [17] have been reported. In addition, relative abundances of Enterococcus and Dysgonomonas increased dramatically by 7.67% and 4.95%, respectively, comparing to bran-fed group. Enterococcus was reported to be associated with PE diet in the gut of both yellow and black mealworms [18,40], and Dysgonomonas was reported in the gut of PS-fed superworms [19], indicating that these genera might play significant roles in PS degradation in the superworm gut. In PS-fed yellow mealworms, comparing to the control, relative abundances of unclassified Enterobacteriaceae and Lactococcus increased to 61.40% and 24.53%, respectively, but Pediococcus and Weissella disappeared, which be probably related to the substances contained in the bran. The results indicated that Pseudomonas, unclassified Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus and Dysgonomonas were associated with PS diet in superworms, while unclassified Enterobacteriaceae and Lactococcus were associated with PS diet in yellow mealworms.

\subsection*{3.4. Response of gut-fungal microbiome}

It has been suggested that the joint metabolic activities of both fungal and bacterial communities play key roles in insect larval gut biodegradation within [7,21]. In this study, Illumina MiSeq of the ITS gene was used to investigate the effect of plastic diets on fungal communities. The Illumina MiSeq sequences of gut fungi were deposited in the GenBank (accession numbers: SRR21384721, SRR21384722, SRR21384723, SRR21384724, SRR21517858 and SRR21517860). A total of 327,584 sequences were obtained with an average of 54597, and the sampling


As shown in the bubble plot (Fig. 6c), there were four predominant fungal phyla, including Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Mucoromycota and Mortierellomycota. Ascomycota was the predominant phyla in bran-fed groups of both larvae species and PS-fed superworms, which were also reported associated with PS ingestion in lesser mealworms of A. diaperinus larvae [7]. The relative abundance of Basidiomycota increased in PS- and PE-fed yellow mealworm guts, suggesting that Basidiomycota was strongly associated with plastics diets in yellow mealworms.

Changes of relative abundances of the top 15 abundant fungal genera with \(>1 \%\) relative abundances in both species were analyzed and shown in Fig. 6d and e, respectively. In contrast to bacteria, there was a higher diversity of fungi in plastic-fed groups compared to bran-fed samples. Hyphopichia and Debaryomyces were predominant fungi in guts of both bran-fed superworms and yellow mealworms. In PE-fed superworms, 3 OTUs including Issatchenka, Wickerhamomyces and Rhizomucor were the dominant genera, accounting for 31.36\%, 26.33\% and 13.76\%, in comparison to bran-fed group (<0.01\%), respectively. In PS-fed superworms, Issatchenka had a relative abundance of 30.95\%. The dominance of Issatchenka was unique and its association with plastic-degradation was not reported in literatures yet. In PS- and PE-fed yellow mealworms, Debaryomyces and Hyphopichia disappeared although they were dominant in bran-fed group. In contrast, Rhodotorula and Cryptococcus showed higher relative abundances of 27.95\% and 65.80\% in PS-fed group, as well as 53.45\% and 35.12\% in PE-fed group, indicating that Rhodotorula and Cryptococcus were probably specific functional groups associated with PS and PE degradation in yellow mealworms.

As shown in Fig. 6d, in controls with the sole diet of bran, the dominant gut fungi were similar in superworms and yellow mealworms.

In the plastics-fed groups, the dominant fungal OTUs of Hyphopichia and Debaryomyces probably with high carbohydrate metabolism efficiency decreased or disappeared in both larvae species; some fungal genera that were suggested to be associated to plastic degradation appeared or increased significantly, such as Issatchenka, Rhodotorula and Cryptococcus. Although some studies on plastic-degrading fungi isolated from gut of insect have been reported [7,46], they were much fewer than that on bacteria. Therefore, studies on plastic biodegradation fungi and the co-culture of bacteria and fungi in the plastics biodegradation process should be further carried out, which will be of great significance to uncover the plastics degradation process in gut of insect larvae.

To our knowledge, until now, there is only one report on the increase abundances of insect larvae gut fungi such as Aspergillus, Penicillium, Hyphoderma and Trichoderma in PS-fed lesser mealworms of A. diaperinus larvae [7]. However, fungi have been considered as potential candidates for LDPE degradation due to their ability of attaching on the polymer surface by synthesizing hydrophobic proteins [8,24]. Aspergillus from the guts of wax moth G. mellonella larvae has been reported for the degradation of PE plastic [46]. In our study, Cryptococcus and Rhodotorula were strongly associated to both PE and PS diet in yellow mealworms, while Issatchenka was associated with both PE and PS diet in superworms.

Overall, the core gut functional microbiome compositions in both superworms and yellow mealworms not only related to feedstocks, but also the species origins. Changes of gut bacterial and fungal communities in response to different plastic diets were observed, providing evidence for their important roles in the plastic degradation process.

Conclusions

Long-term foam plastic supply as sole feedstocks had adverse effects on growth, pupation, and generation completion in both superworms and yellow mealworms. The survival rates and plastic consumption rates declined rapidly after 30 days. Plastic consumption rates varied depending on larvae species. The higher cumulative consumptions of PS and PE foam were observed in superworms, while the plastics depolymerization and biodegradation was extensive in yellow mealworms. The gut bacterial communities of PS-fed superworms and yellow mealworms were similar, but significantly different between PE-fed of them. The yellow mealworms gut fungal communities were not significantly different between PE- and PS-fed groups, but superworms gut fungal communities were significantly different between PS- and PE-fed groups compared to the control. To our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study reporting responses of both gut bacterial- and fungal-microbiomes in relation to plastic feedstocks and larvae species. Future studies such as isolation of individual fungi species, and the co-cultures of gut bacteria and fungi in relation to plastic degradation processes will facilitate the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of plastic degradation in larval guts.
