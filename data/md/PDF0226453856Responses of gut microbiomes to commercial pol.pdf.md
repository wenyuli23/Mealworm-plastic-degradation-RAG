Metabolome Gut microbiota

Environmental Implication
Improper disposal of plastics can release toxic chemicals and pollutants into nature. It leads to the formation of microplastics and nanoplastics, which accumulate in the environment, impact natural habitats, and induce reproductive, neuro, and immune toxicities in all life forms.

For the first time, we characterized and found PET degradation efficiency by mealworms was faster than other known microorganisms. Through omics analyses, we explored how the larvae survive and utilize PET as carbon sources under nutritional stress of PET feeding. This breakthrough opens a new avenue for rapid and low-carbon biodegradation of petroleum-based plastics.

\section*{1. Introduction}

Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a semicrystalline thermoplastic polymer of aliphatic-aromatic polyester group with the chemical formula \(\left[\mathrm{C}_{10} \mathrm{H}_{8} \mathrm{O}_{4}\right]_{n}\) [1,2]. PET incorporates into our daily life mainly in manufacturing materials for textile fibers, packaging, household, etc. [3] and is well known as "Polyester" in the textile industry [4]. Global PET production is raised continuously by an estimated rate of 8.4\% in 2021 [3]. However, recycle of it to bottles, fiber, films, and sheets is just 28.4\% [5]. The majority is dumped into nature, disrupting ecosystems due to ultimate weathering over time and release of toxic constituents [6].

At present, countermeasures are developed via appropriate mechanical (collected for pelleting), biological, chemical (such as methanalysis, hydrolysis, glycolysis, aminolysis and ammonolysis), and physical treatments [4,7-9]. Therein, biological processing is considered as eco-friendly and cost-effective way to manage plastic/PET waste. Different from non-hydrolysable polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), PET belongs to hydrolysable polymers. PET has hydrolysable ester backbones and thus more susceptible to microbial degradation and enzymatic attack than petrochemical vinyl plastics with solely carbon-carbon backbones [10]. Enzymatic recycling of PET has been investigated for more than 20 years [11,12]. However, as separate polymer chains of PET are held together by van der Waals forces and H-bonding and the crystalline structures of PET polymers have hydrophobic surfaces, efficient methods for bio-depolymerization of PET are yet considered a bottle neck [13,14].

In recent years, insect larvae belonging to darkling beetle family (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) [15-23], pyralid moths family (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) [24-29], and other macroinvertebrates [30,31] have been identified to biodegrade major plastic polymers including PS, PE, PP, PVC and PUR. Tenebrio molitor (T. molitor, mealworms), which is commercially available as pet feed and easily breed, is able to degrade plastics within short digestive time (about 12-15 hrs in intestine) and has been well-studied [32-37]. The ingested plastic polymers were degraded rapidly, resulting in short half-life between 3.4 and 16.6 hrs, depending on polymer type and molecular weight (Table S1). The half-life of plastics in the larvae was only 0.015-1.79\% of that of bacterial cultures tested in vitro of 924-21789 hrs (Table S1). Polymer molecular weight, which is presented as number-average molecular weight \(\left(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{n}}\right)\), weight-average molecular weight \(\left(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{w}}\right)\) and size-average molecular weight \(\left(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{s}}\right)\), has strong impact on depolymerization, biodegradation and gut microbiome during plastics degradation by \(T\). molitor [38,39]. Although biodegradation of above major plastics in \(T\). molitor larvae has been confirmed [19,40-42], the biodegradation and depolymerization of polyester or PET plastics (i.e. PET) in \(T\). molitor larvae have not been characterized and the microbiome has not yet been well investigated.

In this research report, we investigated PET degradation by \(T\). molitor larvae with two commercial PET polymer resins with \(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{n}}\) of respective 29.43 kDa and 39.58 kDa, compared the PET biodegradation performance, and characterized gut microbiome and metabolome of the larvae degrading the commercial PET polymers. The results indicated that the biodegradation of PET polymers resulted in different gut microbiomes and metabolomes from the larvae fed high purity PET MPs with defined molecular weights.

\section*{2. Materials and methods}

\subsection*{2.1. T. molitor species and feedstocks}

\(T\). molitor larvae (weighting 27.13 \pm 0.5 mg/larvae) tested for biodegradation were purchased from a breeding farm in Dezhou, Shandong, China. The larvae were fed with wheat bran (WB) prior to testing.

Commercial PET resin in form of microplastic (MP) powders (<75 \(\mu \mathrm{m}\) ) with \(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{n}}\) of 24.83 kDa and \(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{w}}\) of 39.33 kDa and crystallinity degree of 22.8 \pm 3.06 was purchased from Hongyuan Plastic Factory (Shanghai, China) and another PET MP powders with \(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{n}}\) of 18.59 kDa and \(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{w}}\) of 29.43 kDa and crystallinity degree of 18 \pm 2.25\% from Zhongxin Plastic Factory (Guangdong, China) (Fig. S1a and b). The two commercial plastics were tested and compared for biodegradation. According to the manufacturers and our analysis (Supporting Information, Text S1), they did not contain toxic and organic additives or catalysts and were named in this study as PET-1 and PET-2, respectively, for comparison. They had trace ash components (<0.02\%, w/w) including Na, Mg, P, S, Ca, Fe and Zn but well below the levels supporting microbial growth.

WB was purchased from a breeding farm in Dezhou, Shandong, China. Agar powder was biological reagent and was purchased from Aoboxing Biotechnology Co., Ltd (Beijing, China). It was used as adhensive to make agar-PET gel to feed the larvae. 1,1,1,3,3-hexafluorisopropyl solvent (HFIP, 99.5\%) was obtained Aladdin Reagent Int., (Shanghai, China). All other chemicals were purchased from Macklin (Shanghai, China).

\subsection*{2.2. Biodegradation of PET polymers}

Prior to the experiment, the larvae were starved for \(24 \mathrm{~h}\) to digest


2.5. Metabolome analysis

Untargeted metabolomic profiling was performed by the ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole exactive mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q Exactive system, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Digestive tract samples were collected from the larvae fed PET-2 and agar. Detailed experimental procedure described in Supplemental Text S5. The generated raw data were preprocessed by Progenesis QI (Waters Corporation, Milford, USA) and searched in the main database of HMDB (http://www.hmdb.ca/), Metlin (https://metlin.scripps.edu/) and Majorbio Database. During the data analysis, metabolic features detected at least 80% in any sample set were retained. In the normalized data matrix, variables with relative standard deviation > 30% of QC samples were removed, and log10 logarithmization was performed to obtain the final data matrix for subsequent analysis.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Consumption of PET microplastics by T. molitor larvae

The T. molitor larvae actively ate the PET-agar-gels made of PET-1 MPs and PET-2 MPs (Fig. 1a). PET-agar gels of 30.68 ± 0.11 g PET-1 and 33.86 ± 0.54 g PET-2 were respectively ingested by the group of 500 larvae over a 36-day period, and the respective average SPCR were 190 ± 3.0 mg PET 100 larvae \({ }^{-1} \mathrm{~d}^{-1}\) and 203 ± 6.0 mg PET 100 larvae \({ }^{-1} \mathrm{~d}^{-1}\) with specific removal rate more than 136 mg PET 100 larvae \({ }^{-1} \mathrm{~d}^{-1}\) and 152 mg PET 100 larvae \({ }^{-1} \mathrm{~d}^{-1}\) over 36 days, indicating that the consumption rate of PET-1 MPs in this study was slightly lower than PET-2 but still within the similar range.

Sharp increase in averaged weight of the larvae fed with different diets was observed during initial 8 days (Fig. 1b). This is likely due to recovery from previous starvation by digestion ingested carbon sources (WB, PET and agar). As expected, the unfed larvae continued weight loss. After then, the larval weight of PET-1, PET-2 and agar only-fed groups had little changed and slightly dropped to reach final weight within similar range i.e., 38.00 ± 0.79 mg-larvae \({ }^{-1}\) for PET-1, 38.77 ± 1.35 mg-larvae \({ }^{-1}\) for PET-2, and 38.99 ± 2.07 mg-larvae \({ }^{-1}\) for agar on day 36 (Fig. 1c and data in Table S2). The WB-fed group increased to 46.63 ± 0.40 mg-larvae \({ }^{-1}\), as expected while the unfed larvae decreased their weight to 20.35 ± 1.18 mg-larvae \({ }^{-1}\). The similar change in averaged weight of the larvae fed on PET-agar gel and agar only suggested that the larvae likely digested both agar and PET as energy source to support their life activities in comparison with the unfed groups that live on consumption of their body biomass with significant weight loss by 21.92 ± 3.14%. Compared with WB fed larvae, no weight increase or growth was observed in the PET and agar only-fed groups. This is because either agar or PET does not contain important nutrition, such as vitamin, minerals, and amino acids and efficient minerals for cell growth.

As expected, the lowest survival rate was observed in unfed group (44.4% ± 0.52%) while the highest in WB-fed group (91% ± 0.72%) (Fig. 1d). The lower survival rate of agar only gel-fed larvae (65.67 ± 1.63) compared to the PET agar gel-fed larvae (69.93 ± 1.92 and 76.07 ± 0.90 for PET-1 and PET-2, respectively) suggested that the larvae fed with PET-agar gel received more energy source than agar only for survival (Fig. 1d and S2, data in Table S2). Because PET-agar gel fed and agar only gel-fed groups received same amount of agar, the higher survival rates of PET-agar-fed groups than agar only-fed group supported that the larvae received energy from digestion or biodegradation of PET. This observation was similar to those observed previously when the larvae were fed with other plastic foams in comparison with the unfed control or the WB-fed control, and weight loss and SR decline were observed as T. molitor larvae were fed PS, LDPE, PVC, and PP as sole diet, indicating that plastics did not have adequate nutrition sources for larvae although the ingested plastics were able to contribute to energy and even assimilated as carbon source of the larval biomass [22].


The results implied that PET did not provide necessary nutrition and efficient minerals for the larvae growth and development for a long term although its digestion sustained the life and activity of larvae.

In addition, we measured the water content of mealworms supplemented with PET agar gel and agar gel alone, and found that the water content was in the similar range i.e. 58.3 ± 0.98% and 62.1 ± 1.04%, respectively. Since T. molitor larvae have the ability to store water in their body [45,46], the water content in agar gel helped their higher survival rates than unfed larvae.

The SPCRs were calculated every four days over 36-day test period (Fig. 1e, data in Tables S2 and S3). The larvae exhibited slightly higher consumption rates for PET-2 than PET-1 during initial 8 days, then declined on day 12 and day 16 then gradually elevated (Fig. 1e). The initial higher rates could be forced by previous starvation. The decrease in SPCRs within the first 16 days could be due to the inadaptation of the larval metabolism to PET diets after initial forced eating behavior. The gradual increase after day 16 suggested that the larvae and their gut microbiota adapted new feedstock and stabilized their digestive system to PET-agar gel. According to previous studies [33,47], plastic-degrading bacterial strains colonized and showed signs of respiration on plastics (e.g., PS and PE) after 2 weeks of in vitro cultivation. The gut microbes for PET degradation could adapt PET more rapidly in vivo but still takes time. The increase in the PET consumption rate by the larvae was possibly helped by the shift of the gut microbiota to accommodate the PET diet as well as agar. The averaged SPCRs of both PET polymers over 36 days (190 ± 3.0 mg PET-1•100 larva−1 d−1 and 203 ± 6.0 mg PET-2•100 larva−1 d−1) were generally higher than the those of other plastic materials consumed by T. molitor larvae published before, i.e., PS at 8.46 ± 0.14–20.71 ± 0.51 mg•100 larva−1•day−1 as tests [15,37], LDPE foam at 4.9 ± 0.3 mg•100 larva−1 d−1 day−1 to about 23.5 mg•100 larva−1 d−1 day−1 [15,41], PVC MPs at 36.62 ± 6.79 mg•100 larva−1 d−1 [19], PLA powder at 45.2–202.7 mg•100 larva−1 d−1 [48], PP foam at 1.0–1.6 mg• 100 larva−1 d−1 [42], PUR foam at 18 mg•100 larva−1 d−1 [17] using the

The residual PET polymers in the egested frass were determined using the HFIP extractable fraction in the frass of the larvae fed the PET MPs. The HFIP extractable fraction (\%, w/w) decreased gradually over the 36-day test period (Fig. 1f and Table S3). The undigested and partially digested PET residues in the frass of the larvae fed with both PET-1 and PET-2 appeared to be insignificantly different. For PET-1 and PET-2, the polymer residues in the frass decreased gradually from initial 42.45 ± 2.53% and 40.92 ± 2.09% on day 4-34.36 ± 2.91% and 33.70 ± 2.39% on day 16, respectively. Thereafter, they decreased continually, and reached only 15.24 ± 2.79% and 10.11 ± 1.61%, on day 36 with 84.76% and 89.89% mass reduction for the PET-1 and PET-2, respectively. The consumed PET and agar could be converted to CO2 assimilated to larval biomass, and egested as degraded intermediates in frass residues as described during PS biodegradation by T. molitor larvae by feeding PS only previously [22]. Due to the feeding mixture of PET and agar together in this study, it was impossible to determine stoichiometric carbon mass balance. However, future research is still needed to overcome the technical challenge.

Over 36 days, the averaged mass reduction was 71.03% and 73.28% for the ingested PET-1 and PET-2. Recent study indicated that passage through digestive tract, no nanoplastics (NPs) appeared in the frass of PE-fed and PS-fed T. molitor larvae [49]. With much higher removal efficiency of PET than PS and PE, we expected no, PET NP accumulation in the frass. Future study is needed to verify this hypothesis.

Similar to consumption rates discussed above, the degradation rates and mass reduction efficiencies of PET by T. molitor larvae are higher than those reported on other persistent plastics (i.e., PS, PE, and PVC) but are slightly lower than those of biodegradable polymer PLA [48]. This is basically due to polymer biodegradability as described during plastic degradation in environment [50]. In addition, the half-life of PET polymers (3.36 and 4.32 hr for respective PET-1and PET-2) during biodegradation by T. molitor larvae is much shorter than that (924 hr) of in vitro PET-degrading bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6, which had the highest PET degrading capacity [51].

3.2. PET depolymerization and oxidation/biodegradation

\(M_{\mathrm{n}}\), \(M_{\mathrm{w}}\) and \(M_{\mathrm{z}}\) are key molecular weight (MW) parameters and provide information on the changes in molecular properties and polymer structures. The results of GPC analysis indicated that MWs of residual polymers from the frass of larvae fed with both PETs decreased significantly \((p<0.001)\) (Fig. 2a, data in Table S2), i.e., \(M_{\mathrm{n}}\) values of PET-1 and PET-2 decreased by 10.49\% and 19.32\%, respectively; \(M_{\mathrm{w}}\) declined by 9.22\% and 12.5\%, respectively; \(M_{\mathrm{z}}\) dropped by 9.37\% and 10.4\%, respectively, implying that significant reduction of PET polymer chains with a broad depolymerization pattern (decrease in all the \(M_{\mathrm{n}}\), \(M_{\mathrm{w}}\), and \(M_{\mathrm{z}}\)) [19,44]. MW distribution of the two PET MPs indicated a clear shift to small MW side after PETs were ingested (Fig. 2b and c). PDI gives an indication of the broadness of the polymer distribution. After passing through the larval gut, PDI of PET-1 and PET-2 increased from 1.58 to 1.60 and 1.48–1.72, respectively, indicating broaden in the MW of residual polymer due to decomposition. The depolymerization extent or molecular weight reduction of PET-2 was slightly higher than PET-1 that had slightly higher MW, indicating that the PET polymer with lower MW can be depolymerized at the higher extent. The same trend was observed during biodegradation of PE by \(T\). molitor larvae previously [38,39].

FT-IR and \({ }^{1} \mathrm{H}\) NMR analysis confirmed the biodegradation of both PET MPs (Fig. 2d and e). Based on the FT-IR spectra (Fig. 2d), four main characteristic peaks of raw PET MPs at wavenumbers 725, 1090, 1240, and 1713 cm \({ }^{-1}\), corresponding to aromatic (C-H), ether aliphatic (C-O), ether aromatic (C-O), and carbonyl (C = O) bond were dampened or even disappeared after passage through the larval gut. Similar ATR-FTIR spectra were observed on the surface of PET bottles after significant degradation in marine environment, reported by Loakeimidis et al. [52].

\({ }^{1} \mathrm{H}\) NMR spectra of the two PETs displayed one characteristic peak at \(\delta 3.31 \mathrm{ppm}\) (Fig. 2e), which is assigned to the \(-\mathrm{CH}\) in the main chain. After biodegradation, the peaks of \(-\mathrm{CH}\) were absent in both of the residue polymers due to the breakage of benzene ring. Furthermore, the formation of new peaks, i.e., methyl (–CH3), methylene (–CH2), methylene protons of \(\mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{O}\) [53] and other small peaks, in residual PET polymers indicated the breakdown of long chain polymers during degradation.

The results of FTIR and \({ }^{1} \mathrm{H}\) NMR provided qualitative evidence of PET degradation and oxidation. Based on our analyses by GPC, FTIR and \({ }^{1} \mathrm{H}\) NMR of the frass of the larvae fed two commercial PET MPs, a general conclusion is that \(T\). molitor larvae are capable of decomposing PET polymers.

The results also showed the impact of polymer MW and crystallinity on PET degradation. PET-1 had higher crystallinity degree and MW than PET-2, the lower SR of the PET-1-fed larvae, and lower PET consumption and degradation rate, and lower depolymerization extent were likely attributed to the impact of crystallinity and MW on biological attack. Increased crystallinity limits the movement of polymer chains and regularly-arranged crystalline region increase the hydrophobicity of the polymer [54]. The higher crystallinity and higher MW decrease the availability of polymer chains in enzymatic attack and cause lower degradation rates [50,55].

3.3. Microbial communities associated to PET biodegradation

The research on gut microbial communities was conducted using the larvae fed with PET-2 because the biodegradation of PET-1 and PET-2 showed a similar performance. We examined the role of gut microbiomes associated to PET degradation using the larvae fed PET-2.

Antibiotic suppression test was conducted to examine the depolymerization and biodegradation of PET in the presence of five antibiotics (gentamicin sulfate, erythrocin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ampicillin, and kanamycin at 0.075 mg/mg PET) in feed. This antibiotic mixture inhibits gut microbes belonging to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. After a 5-day antibiotic treatment, no gut bacteria were detected in the bacteria counting media (Fig. S2a and b), indicating suppression of gut bacteria by the antibiotics. The \(M_{\mathrm{n}}\), \(M_{\mathrm{w}}\) and \(M_{\mathrm{z}}\) of residual PET in the frass of the larvae under antibiotic suppression were similar to those without antibiotic treatment (Fig. S2c). The results indicated that the larvae biodegraded PET under suppression of gut bacteria, i.e., PET biodegradation was independent of gut bacteria. This observation is different from previous observations of PS and LDPE biodegradation i.e., PS or LDPE depolymerization was almost completely stopped or severely inhibited under antibiotic suppression [56,57]. It is noticed that the antibiotic treatment ignored the role of archaea and eukaryote because their abundance (<1%) was too low to be considered to play a significant role in PET biodegradation in the larvae (Text S6 and Text S7).

At the end of the experimental period of 36 days, 16 S rRNA gene amplicons were sequenced and gut microbial communities of \(T\). molitor larvae of three diet groups were analyzed: WB-reared (normal diet), PET-fed and unfed group. The rarefaction curves with a Shannon index of all samples reached a plateau at approximately 4000 reads, implying that the number of sequences were sufficient for further analysis (Fig. S3a). The \(\alpha\) diversity (Fig. S3b and c) of PET- and WB-fed samples and their OTU numbers (Fig. S3d) were not significantly different \((p>0.05)\). Analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) boxplot showed that the difference among groups was greater than that within groups \(\left(R^{2}>0\right)\), indicating that the sample grouping was statistically significant (Fig. S3e).

Changes in the relative abundance of OTUs in the larvae fed with PET diet were remarkable compared with the WB-fed and unfed groups at the family level (Fig. 3a). Ingestion of PET led to significant increase in the relative abundance of families Spiroplasmataceae, Enterococcaceae and Dysgonomonadaceae. According to the abundance bubble diagram (Fig. 3c and data in Table S5), OTUs at the genus level included Spiroplasma sp. (41.63\%), Acinetobacter sp. (12.28\%), Hafnia-Obesumbacterium sp. (6.50\%), Citrobacter sp. (5.70\%), Enterococcus sp. (5.22\%), Lactococcus sp. (5.04\%), and Dysgonomonas sp. (2.4\%) as dominant genera (abundance > 2\%). Enterococcus sp. was reported as a plastic-degrading genus enriched or isolated from environments as plastic-degrading bacteria [18,58,59]. Members of Spiroplasma sp. are well known as common gut-associated bacteria in \(T\). molitor larva gut microbiota associated with plastic-degradation, e.g., LDPE, PS, and PLA [21,41,48]. Venn analysis reflects the correspondence and abundance information among different groups of species. As shown in Fig. 3b, only respective 47.17\% and 55.35\% of bacteria in PET-fed larvae had overlaps with the microbiota of unfed and WB-fed larvae, indicating that a majority of gut bacteria from the PET-fed larvae did not exist at a significant level in the larval guts fed with WB or unfed although these three groups had the same gut microbial sources. The results indicated that PET diet shifted gut microbial communities remarkably.

Fold change of differential PET-metabolism related enzymes between PET-fed and WB-fed groups (c) and between PET-fed and unfed groups (d) predicted by PICRUST analysis.

Oxidases, a total 24 of monooxygenases and dioxygenases, were also over-expressed (FC ≥ 1.5) in PET-fed group (Fig. 4c and Data S1). The significantly enriched various oxidases in PET-fed samples implicated that these enzymes could contribute to PET oxidation in the larval gut. PET can be hydrolyzed into bis (2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate and mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate [68]. Mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate can be further hydrolyzed to terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol (EG). Terephthalic acid is usually metabolized to protocatechuic acid by dioxygenase [68]. In this study, the gut microbiome was predicted to produce oxidases that metabolize 4-hydroxyphenylacetate (EC 1.14.14.9), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate (EC 1.13.11.15), 3-phenylpropanoate (EC 1.14.12.19), 3-hydroxyanthranilate (EC 1.13.11.16), and protocatechuic acid (EC 1.13.11.8) because these enzymes were more abundant in the PET-fed samples than WB-fed groups, indicating they could be related to degradation of PET intermediates. Similarly, PET metabolism could occur through a sequential oxidation of EG to glyoxylate via the intermediates glycolaldehyde and glycolate [69] by gut microbes. In comparison with WB-fed and unfed groups, glycolaldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.21) and/or glyoxylate reductase (EC 1.1.1.26) were up-regulated in the PET-fed group (Fig. 4c), suggesting metabolism of EG. These results indicated that the gut bacterial community of PET-fed larvae was capable of decomposing PET into intermediate metabolites of aromatic organic acids and EG, which could be further transformed and enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) prior to mineralization. Other enzymes (i.e., decarboxylase, depolymerase, oxidoreductase, and dehydrogenase) were also over-represented in PET-fed samples compared with WB-fed samples (FC ≥ 1.5). Their contributions to PET biodegradation should be further identified.

Remarkably, the genes functioned as methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs), tightly adherence-related proteins, and flagellin-related proteins were significantly enriched in the PET-fed group according to the gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis (Fig. 4a). Similar over-expression of such proteins was observed during PET [70] and aromatic-aliphatic copolyester [71] degradation by marine bacterial cultures. The functional characteristics of the proteins secreted by the gut microbes is proposed as follows. First, bacteria develop chemotaxis towards aromatic compounds [72]. For example, Ni et al. proposed that a MCP triggers taxis towards aromatic compounds by sensing TCA cycle intermediates [73]. Secondly, the adhesion of microbes onto the surface of PET is ready for plastic biodegradation. For the bacteria with flagella, the adhesion capacity of bacteria is directly proportional to the number of flagella [74], and by reaching into crevices of the target objective, the flagella can grasp onto its surface to enhance bacterial adhesion [75]. Also, the flagella can facilitate electron transport to aid metabolism of organic matter [76]. As a result, bacterial cells with flagellar and developed chemotactic responses could be selected so that they would efficiently seek carbon source under low nutrient availability [77]. Therefore, the above functions were highly expressed in the larvae under starvation condition in this study.

In fact, only PET degraded products with small molecules can enter microbial cells with the help of dedicated transport systems, as reported in PE degradation by Rhodococcus ruber [78,79]. Not surprisingly, predicted GO, such as ATP-binding cassette (K06147), peptide/nickel transport system substrate-binding protein (K02035), and multiple sugar transport system permease protein (K02025) were identified to be the remarkably differential GO in this study (Fig. S6).

\subsection*{3.5. Metabolome analysis}

To comprehensively and systematically understand the pathways of PET biodegradation, non-targeted metabolites were analyzed by LC-MS. These metabolites were results of syngeneic bioreactions by the gut microbiota and the larval host. To exclude the influence of metabolites from agar gel, samples of agar-fed larvae were used as a control. The principal component analysis (PCA) results indicated that the sample of PET diet was fully differentiated from the control (Fig. S7a and b). This was consistent with the results of the hierarchical clustering analysis with a heatmap, which showed a markedly distinction in metabolites between the PET-agar gel fed and agar only gel-fed groups. (Fig. S7c).

Compared with the sample of the agar-fed larvae, 103 metabolites were differentially accumulated in the PET-fed samples (fold change (FC) ≥ 1.0, \(p<0.5\) ) (Fig. 5a, Data S2). According to the HMDB classification results, the identified significantly up-regulated differentially metabolites were classified into 10 HMDB superclass and 20 subclass (Fig. 5b and d). Of these, 41 metabolites were included in the "lipid and lipid-like molecules" (Fig. 5b). The enrichment of lipid metabolites was also observed in plastic-eating insect Galleria mellonella larvae in response to PE and PS feeding [34,80]. G. mellonella larvae compensated for the lack of nutrients in plastic by augmenting lipid metabolic pathways [34]. Gravouil et al. [78] verified that PE fragments could incorporate within phospholipid of degrading microbes, indicating that PE could be assimilated as carbon source. However, besides energy storage and assimilation, there is also possibility that the upregulated lipid metabolic pathways were a partial result of oxidative stress defense. Disruption of lipid homeostasis by MPs has been reported as normal responses of various non-plastics-degrading organisms e.g., earthworms, zebrafish living on plastics [81-83]. However, no research has been done with plastics-degrading insects e.g. T. molitor. Further studies are needed to verify whether PET degraded products can be transformed to lipid and assimilated by T. molitor larvae.

On the other hand, we detected 12, 7, 7, and 3 metabolites in the PET-fed samples belonging to respective organic acids and derivatives, organic oxygen compounds, organoheterocyclic compounds, and benzenoids (Data S3), which were under detection limit in agar-fed samples. These compounds were likely produced from PET degradation as intermediates. The main classes of differentially accumulated metabolites in the commercial PET-fed samples suggested that benzenoids, lipids and lipid like molecules, organic acids and derivative, organic nitrogen compounds, organic oxygen compounds, and organoheterocyclic compounds were PET metabolizing products by the larvae.

KEGG pathways of the 103 differentially expressed metabolites were further analyzed based on topological analysis (TA) (Fig. 5c). Among the enriched KEGG pathways, glycerophospholipid metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism were significantly enriched \((p<0.05)\). Glycerophospholipid metabolism was associated with maintaining optimal physical properties and functions of cell membranes as well as correlated with normal mitochondrial functions in the gut microbiome [38,84]. Arginine and proline metabolism is critical for maintaining osmotic equilibrium and interactions with enzymes to protect the structure of proteins. The above two pathways as well as glutathione metabolism could be stress response caused by microplastics [38,85]. In addition, plastic degradation related pathways involving alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, ether lipid metabolism, and fatty acid degradation were enriched. Amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, which is key carbohydrate metabolism, was also significantly altered in this study. Accordingly, we hypothesized that the biodegradation of PET polymer by the T. molitor larvae could be concorded with induction of oxidative stress related metabolic pathways by both gut microbiota and larval host due to biofragmentation of ingested plastic materials into microplastics within the intestinal environment [38]. Nevertheless, more solid evidence is needed to understand the physiological and toxicological impacts on the gut microbiota and the larvae during the biodegradation process.

\subsection*{3.6. The link between microbes and metabolism}

Most functions in insect digestive tract are performed with the intervention of gut symbionts [86]. Therefore, the correlations between dominant bacteria and differential metabolites provide the relationship between gut microbes and metabolites (Fig. 6). Based on the Pearson algorithm, the correlation calculation showed that different metabolites

and bacteria formed two correlation groups. Similar with the results of bacterial species correlation analysis, Dysgonomonas sp. and Hafnia-Obesumbacterium sp. co-occurred, and they formed one correlation group, which was correlated with lipid and lipid-like molecules. The results suggested that Dysgonomonas sp. and Hafnia-Obesumbacterium sp. could exert similar functions during PET degradation and showed positive correlations with pathways of lipid metabolism (i.e. ether lipid metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism) and carbohydrate metabolism. Particularly, PICRUSt prediction of the gut microbiome did not show significant enrichment of lipid metabolism-related genes, indicating alteration of lipid metabolic pathways was more of a host-specific response on PET uptake. The results suggested that the developed dominant bacteria in the larval gut reprogrammed the lipid metabolism pathways in the host. Plastic diets could not only lead to alterations in dominant intestinal bacteria but also in the physiological and metabolic functions of the host larvae.

\subsection*{3.7. A PET degradation mechanism contributed by the gut microbiota}

As for the role of gut microbiota during PET biodegradation, a plausible mechanism was proposed on the basis of the results in this study and published literatures. Aerobic bacteria, and facultative anaerobic bacteria act together for PET oxidation and depolymerization, while facultative anaerobic and anaerobic bacteria contribute mainly to hydrolysis, fermentation and mineralization. After adhering onto the surface of PET polymer, the microbes secrete extracellular PET hydrolyses and oxidases, along with the similar degradation enzymes released from the host, to initiate PET degradation process and generate degraded products for further metabolism, assimilation, and mineralization. Under nutrient deficient conditions (PET-fed), the gut microorganisms that develop chemotaxis and are equipped with flagella for seeking carbon source are selected or enriched, and nitrogen fixing microbes convert dissolved \(\mathrm{N}_{2}\) to ammonium as \(\mathrm{N}\) source to mitigate nitrogen deficiency. The intermediate products of PET are utilized by various gut microbes and further metabolized into the TCA cycle. With the help of \(\mathrm{O}_{2}\) by oxidases, the degraded intermediates are transformed into compounds such as 4-hydroxyphenylacetate, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate, 3-phenylpropanoate, 3-hydroxyanthranilate and protocatechuic acid as major intermediates by aerobic decomposition. As oxygen is consumed in midgut, depolymerized PET polymer is also further decomposed into formic acid via facultative anaerobic/anaerobic decomposition, which can be further utilized by Dysgonomonas sp. and Hafnia-Obesumbacterium sp. as electron donor source for mineralization.

\section*{4. Conclusions and future studies}

This study has first detailed the biodegradation of commercial PET (or polyester) resin powders in Tenebrio molitor larvae. The results demonstrated that the larvae are capable of rapidly biodegrading PET with the mass reduction efficiency of \(71.03 \%\) and \(73.28 \%\), or PET half-life of 0.14 day and 0.26 day for two commercial PET with molecular weight \(\left(M_{w}\right)\) of 39.33 and 29.43 kDa. T. molitor larvae consumed and biodegraded PET more rapidly than other major non-hydrolysable plastics e.g., PE, PS, PP and PVC as well as hydrolysable PUR polymers reported in literatures. Although PET biodegradation can occur independently under antibiotic suppression of gut bacteria, the gut microbiota has a significant contribution to PET biodegradation. Feeding PET

diet altered gut microbiome and host metabolites. Dominant bacterial genera Spiroplasma sp., Dysgonomonas sp. and Hafnia-Obesumbacterium sp. were observed to be related to PET biodegradation. Bacterial enzymes and GOs related to plastic degradation were enriched or upregulated in the gut microbiome, including PET polymer degrading enzymes (hydrolases, oxidases, decarboxylase, depolymerase, oxidoreductase, and dehydrogenase), chemotaxis proteins, transport proteins, and flagella formation-related proteins. Metabolome analysis indicated the synergistic metabolic pathways of biodegradation, mineralization and assimilation by the gut microbiota and host larvae. During PET degradation process, aerobic bacteria, facultative bacteria, and anaerobic bacteria contributed to biodegrade PET and degraded intermediates. The pathways of lipid metabolism of the host were reprogrammed during PET degradation.

Overall, this study has provided new insights into the biodegradation of plastics by the T. molitor larvae and its associated gut microbial communities. Specially, we proposed possible mechanism and pathways for PET biodegradation in the insect larvae, which open an avenue for further studies, such as isolation and purification of PET degradation keys species, optimization of degradation capacity in vitro. Also, we will examine whether the gut species in larvae exhibit interspecific interactions during degradation of recalcitrant plastics to enable their applications of plastic degradation in the future.
