### Abstract
Yellow and dark mealworms (Tenebrio molitor and Tenebrio obscurus) biodegrade commercial polyethylene (PE) materials at a high rate. We examined the impact of physical and chemical properties on biodegradation using high purity microplastics (MPs). These included high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), all with different weight average molecular weights (Mw) and different crystallinity degrees in T. molitor and T. obscurus larvae. The biodegradation extent in the two mealworms was similar but strongly depended on the polymer type in sequence, since LDPE > LLDPE> HDPE (with respective Mw of 222.5, 110.5 and 182 kDa). When LLDPE MPs with Mw of 0.84, 6.4 and 106.8 kDa and HDPE with Mw of 52, 105 and 132.7 kDa were tested, the PE MPs with lower Mw showed a greater extent of depolymerization. The results of dominance analysis indicated that less branching structure and higher crystallinity degree negatively impacted depolymerization and biodegradation. Py-GC/MS analysis confirmed the breaking of the macromolecule backbone as well as the formation of oxidized functional groups after all the tested PE materials passed through the mealworm intestine. The results demonstrated that molecular weight, PE type, branching, and crystallinity degree significantly affect the biodegradation capability of PE by the mealworms, and possibly by other biological systems as well.

1. Introduction

The discovery of polymer materials in the early 20th century paved the way for the manufacture of plastics, an innovative material which is now abundant in many industries across the world (Rasmussen, 2021). In 2020, the annual production of plastics was found to be upwards of 367 million tons (PlasticsEurope, 2021). Among the hundreds of different global plastics that are in demand distribution by resin type, no polymers are in as high demand as polyethylene (PE), 31.3%; polypropylene (PP), 19.7%; polyvinylchloride (PVC), 9.6%; polyethylene terephthalate (PET), 8.4%; polyurethane (PUR), 7.8%; and polystyrene (PS), 6.1% (PlasticsEurope, 2021). However, because of the prevalence of plastic in society, plastics waste has become a major environmental concern; contamination by plastics solid wastes, debris, microplastics (MPs), and even nanoplastics (NPs) is all on the rise (Geyer et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2017; L. Wang et al., 2020; Z. Wang et al., 2020).

Among the plastics, PE is the most used polymer around the world, with over one trillion plastic bags made of PE being used every year (Geyer et al., 2017). PE is expressed as "[CH2 - CH2]n" and comprises a linear backbone of carbon atoms. Commercial PE polymers include high-density polyethylene (HDPE), linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) (Wilkes and Aristilde, 2017). As shown in the Graphic Abstract, HDPE has a high degree of crystallinity and is composed of linear chains which are packed closely together with a very low level of short chain branching. HDPE has little or no branching and the molecules can stack and form strong intermolecular forces (typically <2 CH2 groups/ 1000 C atoms). LLDPE is composed of linear molecules with no long chains of middle crystallinity as well as a higher level of short chain branching than HDPE. It contains more short branches (10-30 CH2/1000 C), which are caused by the introduction of one or more co-monomers such as 1-butene, 1-hexene, and 1-octene (Ojeda et al., 2011). LDPE is characterized by a significant level of long chain branching (typical branch length of several hundred carbon atoms) as well as short chain branching (2 to 6 carbon atoms long). The short branches of LDPE hinder close packing and result in a relatively low crystallinity (45-60%) because branching chains prevents tight packing into a crystalline structure (Wilkes and Aristilde, 2017). HDPE (as well as middle-density PE) contributes 12.9% of total plastics globally while LDPE and LLDPE contribute 17.4% (PlasticsEurope, 2021). The significant differences in their properties result in a diverse application of the polymers in manufactured products, which range from packaging film and toys to pipes and fuel storage tanks (Zhang et al., 2004; Koutny et al., 2006). On the other hand, the differing structures and physical properties of the PE polymers also affects their biodegradability and the efficiencies of microorganisms in attacking them (Gu, 2003; Hadad et al., 2005; Nowak et al., 2011; Restrepo-Flórez et al., 2014).

Since the early 1970s, tests on the biodegradation of PE products, primarily LDPE, have been performed using microorganisms enriched or isolated from various environmental sources which harbor a multitude of diverse microbial communities. These include sources such as soils, seawater, sludge, landfill, and compost (Restrepo-Flórez et al., 2014; Ghatge et al., 2020; Ru et al., 2020; He and Luo, 2020). These studies concluded that either PE is not biodegradable, or that PE degradation occurs at extremely slow rates (Shah et al., 2008). In studies that concluded the latter, the biodegradation of PE in the environment occurred mainly via the biological activity of microorganisms after photo- or thermo- oxidation (Shah et al., 2008; Wagner and Lambert, 2018). Thus, given appropriate conditions, slow PE biodegradation (in periods of weeks/months) by microorganisms (bacteria, fungus etc.) can be observed, (Ghatge et al., 2020; Ru et al., 2020).

The biodegradation of plastics via microbiological and enzymatic approaches has been investigated for decades (Wei et al., 2020; Inderthal et al., 2021). However, to date, research results, primarily on biodegradation of PET, indicate that physical and chemical structure and properties of the polymers impact degradation and biodegradation, with the major influencing factors including surface hydrophobicity, molecular weight distribution (MWD), physical structure, mechanical property, and crystallinity (Restrepo-Flórez et al., 2014; Shah et al., 2008; Ghatge et al., 2020; Min et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2020; Inderthal et al., 2021). The polymer molecular weight is expressed as the number-averaged (Mn), weight-average (Mw), and size-averaged weight (Mz). In general, non-hydrolyzable plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, etc.) are more resistant to biodegradation than hydrolyzable polymers (PET, PUR, etc.); degradation of longer chains and polymers with higher molecular weight or higher crystallinity is more difficult than that of shorter chain bonds or lower molecular weight or lower crystallinity polymers. Previous studies on plastics degradation, which were mainly focused on PE degradation, reported different results depending on the PE products tested. Previous research reported that low molecular weight PE or low molecular PE wax (molecular weight around 1.0 kDa or less) could be consumed relatively quickly or degraded by bacterial consortium with a mass reduction of 31.5% in 21 days (Kawai et al., 2004). A Pseudomonas sp. degraded PE wax (Mn of 1.7 kDa) in sterilized compost conditions after 80 days (Yoon et al., 2012). Another study on microbial degradation of PE materials of Mn < 1.5 kDa also showed 50% mass reduction in 120 days (Chillini et al., 2003). For higher molecular weight PE, however, it took more than two months for a PE-degrading Enterobacter asburiae YTI and Bacillus sp. YP1 to degrade about 6.5% and 11.3% of commercial LDPE film with a Mw of 88.2 and Mz of 27.7 kDa (Yang et al., 2014). A co-culture of Acinetobacter sp. NyZ450 and Bacillus sp. NyZ451 could reduce 18% of the weight of PE of mulching film (Mn of 27.5 and Mz of 179.3 kDa) over 30 days (Yin et al., 2020). To date, no report has been published to compare the biodegradation performance of PE materials with different molecular weight and physical properties with either mixed cultures or single microbial cultures. Additionally, the impact of crystallinity on PE biodegradation has not yet been specially addressed. Crystallinity defines the degree of long-range order in a material and the more crystalline a polymer, the more regularly aligned its chains. Increasing the degree of crystallinity increases hardness and density. Enzymatic degradation of PET indicated that increasing the degree of crystallinity increases hardness and density and thus negatively affects enzymatic reactions (Inderthal et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2020).

Recently, the ability to rapidly biodegrade plastics (PE and PS) has been found in insect larvae within the darkling beetle families (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), i.e., Tenebrio molitor, Tenebrio obscurus, Zophobas atratus, Tribolium castaneum, Plesiophthalmus davidis, and honey bee pest Uloma sp. (Yang et al., 2015a; Brandon et al., 2018; Peng et al., 2020a, 2020b; Peng et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020

Six high purity LDPE and HDPE powder samples (size <0.4 mm) with different molecular weights were purchased from American Polymer Standards Corp. (Mentor, Ohio, USA) to test the impact of molecular weight and branching on PE biodegradation. The three LDPE powders had a respective \(M_{\mathrm{w}}\) of 0.84, 6.4 and 106.8 kDa corresponding to \(M_{\mathrm{n}}\) of 0.72, 3.2 and 12.9 kDa, while the three HDPE had a respective \(M_{\mathrm{w}}\) of 52, 105 and 132.7 kDa corresponding to \(M_{\mathrm{n}}\) of 18.3, 10.4 and 82.6 kDa, respectively. These six MPs were labeled as LDPE \(_{6400}\), LDPE \(_{6400}\), LDPE \(_{102000}\), HDPE \(_{52000}\), HDPE \(_{105000}\) and HDPE \(_{132700}\) (Fig. S1E). The physical properties of the aforementioned high purity PE MPs are summarized in Tables S1 and S2.

Agar was purchased from Beijing Aoboxing Bio-Tech Co., Ltd. Wheat bran was purchased from a farm in Harbin, China. All chemicals used for analyses were analytical grade from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., Beijing, China.

\subsection*{2.2. Biodegradation of different PE polymers}

The biodegradation of PE was conducted in two tests and in duplicate. The first test was performed to compare three high purity PE polymers. Prior to feeding the larvae, each of the PE MPs (25 g) were mixed in liquid agar (30 mL, 3\%, w/w). After it solidified, the PE-agar mixture was fed to the larvae over 21 days. \(T\). molitor and \(T\). obscurus larvae were divided into two groups, respectively. Each group consisted of three incubators made of food grade PP food containers (1000 mL in volume) with 400 larva each. The larvae were fed with either HDPE, LDPE, or LLDPE MPs as their primary diet for 21 days in order to evaluate biodegradation performance of HDPE, LDPE, and LLDPE, respectively.

The second test was designed to examine biodegradation of LDPE and HDPE MPs with different molecular weights. Prior to testing, the PE MPs (0.4 g) were mixed with distilled water (0.25 mL) and wheat bran (0.4 g), resulting in a PE-bran mixture. The test matrix consisted of six \(T\). molitor incubators and six \(T\). obscurus incubators (400 larvae in each incubator) set up according to the same conditions as the first test. The mealworms were fed with the respective PE-bran mixtures (i.e., LDPE \(_{6400}\), LDPE \(_{6400}\), LDPE \(_{102000}\), HDPE \(_{52000}\), HDPE \(_{105000}\), and HDPE \(_{132700}\) ) for 5 to 15 days. The incubation duration ended when all PE MPs were ingested by the larvae. During incubation, dead mealworms were removed immediately to avoid cannibalism. All incubators were maintained in a 250 L artificial climate chamber (Artificial climate incubator, Shanghai Shuli, Shanghai, China) at \(25 \pm 0.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) and \(65 \pm 5 \%\) humidity.

At the end of the test, the larvae were cleaned with compressed air and then transferred to a clean box for 12 and 18 h to collect frass samples. The frass samples from samples of duplicate incubators were combined together and then stored in a refrigerator at \(-20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) (BCD-215WTM, Media, Shenzhen, China) for further analysis.

\subsection*{2.3. Characterization of residual PE polymers in frass}

All analyses were detailed in supporting information (SI) and employed using established methods for the characterization of plastic biodegradation as described in previous publications (Brandon et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2018a, 2018b; Peng et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2021a, 2021b, 2021c; Wu and Criddle, 2021). All analyses were performed in triplicate.

To characterize the depolymerization of PE polymers in frass, the residual PE in the frass was extracted using 1, 2, 4-trichlorobenzene (1, 2, 4 TCB). \(M_{\mathrm{n}}, M_{\mathrm{w}}\), and \(M_{\mathrm{w}}\) were determined by high-temperature gel permeation chromatography (HT-GPC) (PL-GPC 220, Agilent Technologies, Inc., USA) at \(150^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) using 200 \(\mu \mathrm{L}\) injection volume with an eluent (1,2,4 TCB) flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The analysis was performed as described previously (Yang et al., 2021a, 2021c). Polydispersity index (PDI) was calculated as PDI \(=M_{\mathrm{w}} / M_{\mathrm{n}}\), which gives an indication of broadness of the polymer distribution (Wu and Criddle, 2021). The reduction of molecular weight (\%) was calculated as:

\[
R(\%)=\left(M_{\mathrm{n}}-M_{\mathrm{f}}\right) / M_{\mathrm{n}} \times 100 \%
\]

where R is the change (\%), M<sub>v</sub> is the molecular weight of the virgin PE sample, and M<sub>r</sub> is the molecular weight of residual PE extracted from frass. When molecular weight decreases, R is expressed as a positive value. When molecular weight increases, the R value becomes negative.

Analyses of the water contact angle (WCA) of the PE powder and frass samples from PE-fed larvae were performed using Dataphysics DCA21 (Heilna Trade GmbH, Germany).

Characterization of oxidation/biodegradation of PE was performed using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Nicolet iS50 FTIR Spectrometer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, U.S.A.), Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy with a Bruker Avance 600 MHz NMR spectrometer (Bruker Corporation, Germany), an X-ray diffraction instrument (Bruker D8 Advance, Germany), and Pyrolysis-gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) with an Agilent GC/MS instrument (7890B-5977B GC/MS from Agilent Technologies, USA) combined with a PY-3030D pyrolyzer unit (EGA/PY-3030D, Frontier, Japan) from Frontier Laboratories. FTIR was used to characterize the chemical modification of the polymer structures and monitor the formation of major oxidized functional groups of the residual PE polymers in the frass (Wu and Cridde, 2021). 1H NMR was conducted to characterize the chemical modification of PE polymers as well as the degraded functional groups in the egested frass (Wu and Cridde, 2021), while spectra were analyzed using MestReNova software (version 6.1.1–6384-Win). Crystallinity degrees of the different PE MP powders were determined using an X-ray diffraction instrument. Py-GC/ MS was performed to study the difference in chemical composition between original PE samples and residual PE polymers from the frass.

\subsection*{2.4. Dominance analysis}

Dominance analysis (DA) was conducted to determine factors influencing PE biodegradation based on the method originally developed by Budescu's (1993) for the determination of predictor importance. In this study, we replaced the predictors with variables which are considered to have an impact on plastics biodegradation. This method is unique in that (a) it measures relative importance for each variable alone (e.g., R²), and (b) the two variables (or predictors in the original model) are compared in the context of all \(2^{(p-2)}\) models that contain some subset of the other variables, where p is the number of predictors. DA is more sensitive to the various importance patterns that can emerge in these cases and addresses a more general definition of importance. The criterion of general dominance for the ranking and scaling of importance across all the variables is presented for comparing the relative importance of variables (or predictors) in multiple regression (Azen and Budescu, 2003). Mathematically, general dominance weights are equal to the squared semi-partial correlation coefficients for each predictor averaged across all possible subset regression models.

To conduct the DA and relative weights, we firstly specified a multiple linear regression (MLR) model in a certain population with \(p(p \geq 1)\) variables \(\left(X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots, X_{p}\right)\) and one dependent variable \(Y\) :

\[
Y=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1} X_{1}+\ldots+\beta_{p} X_{p}+\epsilon=\beta_{0}+\sum_{j=1}^{p} \beta_{j} X_{j}+\epsilon
\]

where \(\beta_{0}\) represents the constants, \(\beta_{j}\) is the population regression coefficient associated with the \(j\) th variable (predictor) \(\left(X_{j}\right)\), and \(\epsilon \sim N\left(0, \sigma^{2}\right)\). The randomly selected set of \(n\) observations from that population will consist of \(\left(y_{i}, x_{i 1}, x_{i 2}, \ldots, x_{i p}\right) ; i=1,2, \ldots, n\). In this study, six variables including the PE type, mealworm species, \(M_{\mathrm{m}}, M_{\mathrm{w}}, M_{\mathrm{s}}\) and crystallinity degree \(\left(X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}, X_{4}, X_{5}\right.\), and \(X_{6}\) ) describe the biodegradation of PE \(\left(Y, M_{\mathrm{r}}\right.\) reduction (\%), \(M_{\mathrm{w}}\) reduction (\%), and \(M_{\mathrm{s}}\) reduction (\%), respectively). Using this dataset, unweighted least squares were introduced to obtain the estimated linear model, as shown in Eq. (3):

\[
\hat{y}=\widehat{\beta}_{0}+\sum_{j=1}^{p} \widehat{\beta}_{j} x_{j}
\]

where \(\widehat{\beta}_{j}\) is the estimated regression coefficient associated with \(x_{j}\).

We defined the model's predicted values as shown in Eq. (4):

\[
\hat{Y}=\sum_{j=1}^{p} B_{j} x_{j}
\]

where \(B_{j}\) is the standardized regression coefficient associated with \(x_{j}\).

MLR analysis is a statistical method that uses multiple explanatory variables to predict or explain response variable. The major purposes of MLR analysis are prediction and interpretation. To analyze and interpret the function and significance of each variable on the dependent variable, the relative importance of each variable in the regression model was compared. A central principle of MLR analysis is the partitioning of the sum of squares of deviations (SSY, a measure of the variability in the response) into the regression sum of squares (SSR, the variability explained by the predictor variables \(x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{p}\) ) and the residual (or error) sum of squares (SSE) (Chao et al., 2008). We denoted the squared correlation between the observed \((Y)\) and predicted \((\hat{Y})\) values as the squared multiple correlation \(\left(R_{y}^{2}\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{p}\right)\right)\), which is also known as the coefficient of determination \(\left(R^{2}\right)\), as shown in Eq. (5):

\[
R^{2}=\frac{\mathrm{SSR}}{\mathrm{SSY}}
\]

The value of \(R^{2}(=\mathrm{SSR}\) in the unit length standardized regression model) reflects the relative degree of regression contribution, a measure often used to quantify model fit and which is interpreted as the proportion of the variance in \(Y\) that can be reproduced, or accounted for, by the \(p\) variables (or predictors) (Azen and Budescu, 2003). In this study, variables for PE degradation included molecular weights (i.e., \(M_{\mathrm{m}}, M_{\mathrm{w}}\), and \(M_{\mathrm{s}}\) ), crystallinity degree, and mealworm species. R statistical software was used for data analysis and model development.

\subsection*{2.5. Statistical analysis}

Statistical analyses were performed in IBM SPSS Statistics (version 25). To evaluate the differences in PE consumption as well as in changes in molecular weight, ANOVA was performed on the egested frass, followed by pairwise comparisons using Student's \(t\)-test with Tukey's correction to assess the differences between diets and species. All \(p\)-values are adjusted \(p\) values, and all error values are reported as average \pm standard deviation.

\section*{3. Results and discussion}

\subsection*{3.1. Depolymerization/degradation of LDPE, LLDPE and HDPE in mealworms}

The consumption of the LLDPE, LDPE, and HDPE MPs by \(T\). molitor and \(T\). obscurus larvae was monitored over 21 days (Table 1, Fig. 1A1-A3). The larvae consumed 1.8-2.5 g PE/100 larvae. At the end of test, frass samples were collected for HT-GPC analysis. We used \(M_{\mathrm{m}}, M_{\mathrm{w}}\), and \(M_{\mathrm{s}}\) to examine the performance of depolymerization as well as biodegradation, as depolymerization is the first and essential step of the biodegradation of plastics (Wu and Cridde, 2021). \(M_{\mathrm{m}}\) provides information about the lowest molecular weight portion of the sample, \(M_{\mathrm{w}}\) is the average closest to the center of molecular distribution curve, and \(M_{\mathrm{s}}\)

The unchanged Mz also indicated no or less breaking down of large molecular chains.

The molecular weights of the residual polymers from frass of T. molitor and T. obscurus larvae fed with LLDPE also increased significantly (Table 1, p < 0.05), i.e., Mn increased by 69.67 ± 0.12% and 94.79 ± 0.51%, Mw increased by 62.17 ± 0.24% and 75.11 ± 0.44%, and Mz by 67.10 ± 0.56% and 75.43 ± 0.59%, respectively. This indicated that the larvae of both mealworms performed depolymerization of shorter chain polymers more rapidly, resulting in accumulation of longer chain polymers. The significant increases (p < 0.05) in Mn and Mw of residual LLDPE and HDPE in the frass of the larvae of both species confirmed that both performed limited extent depolymerization (increase in Mw and/or Mz). The increase in Mz indicated that the long chain polymers also accumulated in the residual PE, which was different from what was observed during HDPE depolymerization.

The molecular weights of residual polymers from the frass of T. molitor and T. obscurus larvae fed with LDPE decreased significantly (Table 1), i.e., Mn decreased by 27.47 ± 0.08% and 25.97 ± 0.16%, Mw decreased by 28.58 ± 0.15% and 27.01 ± 0.14%, and Mz decreased by 32.86 ± 0.14% and 31.00 ± 0.30%, respectively. This showed a typical broad depolymerization pattern and indicated that the larvae depolymerized and biodegraded all chains simultaneously.

The depolymerization and biodegradation pattern of LLDPE and HDPE by both Tenebrio species demonstrated limited extent pattern (i.e., increase in Mw and Mz) which was similar to what was observed in LDPE biodegradation by T. molitor larvae from another source in Beijing, China (Yang et al., 2021a), as well as with biodegradation of PP foam by T. molitor in our lab (Yang et al., 2021b), and with PP degradation by a mesophilic bacterium Stenotrophomonas strain (Jeon and Kim, 2016). Interestingly, the depolymerization of LLDPE resulted in the increase of Mw, which was not reported previously. In this work, however, noticeable reductions in Mw, Mz, and Mz of LDPE by both larvae of T. molitor and T. obscurus indicated significant broad depolymerization: Mw, Mz, and Mz of LDPE (p < 0.05).

(C1, C2, C3) 1H NMR spectra of residual PE polymers from the frass of T. molitor and T. obscurus fed respective LLDPE, LDPE, and HDPE only. During incubation, PE MPs (25 g) was mixed with agar (30 ml, 3%, w/w) during the test. Y = T. molitor larvae; D = T. obscurus larvae. All samples for analyses were obtained on day 21.


(Table 1, Fig. 1A2). The limited extent depolymerization was also observed in superworms (Zophobas atratus larvae) from Guangzhou, China and Marion, USA, who were fed with LDPE foam with respective \( M_{\mathrm{n}} \) of 173.4 and 248.0 kDa and \( M_{\mathrm{s}} \) of 40.4 and 36.3 kDa. After one month, \( M_{\mathrm{n}} \) was increased by 63.8\% and 8.8\% and \( M_{\mathrm{s}} \) was increased by 26.2\% and 44.1\%, respectively (Peng et al., 2020b). In addition, a publication on biodegradation of polyurethane (PUR) by a landfill microbial culture reported that initially, the \( M_{\mathrm{n}} \) of PUR increased from 208.5 to 229.4 kDa and then decreased to 169.9 kDa (Gaytán et al., 2019). Another report indicated PS degradation in Galleria mellonella larvae (Lou et al., 2020) with an increase in \( M_{\mathrm{n}} \) from 132.1 to 146.9 kDa as well as in \( M_{\mathrm{s}} \) from 361.7 to 377.8 kDa. The limited extent depolymerization of LLDPE and HDPE was likely related to the selective depolymerization of lower molecular polymers at a higher rate than longer chain polymers. However, the presence of crosslinking reactions during depolymerization, biodegradation, or both might also occur. Further study is needed to understand whether this mechanism contributes to the formation of longer chain polymers in the frass.

This pattern was observed in the biodegradation of LDPE by both species, which was broad depolymerization (i.e., decrease in \( M_{\mathrm{n}} \), \( M_{\mathrm{s}} \) as well as \( M_{\mathrm{s}} \)) in agreement with the results of previous research on biodegradation of LDPE and PS in both Tenebrio species (Brandon et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2018a, 2018b; Peng et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2021c). The polydispersity index (PDI) of HDPE dropped from 3.06 to 2.59 or 2.50, PDI of LLDPE slightly decreased from 2.62 to 2.50 or 2.35, but PDI of LLDPE remained basically unchanged at 2.39, compared to the PDI at 2.35 for both \( T. molitor \) and \( T. obscurus \) larvae (Tables S1 and 1).

Analysis of molecular weight distribution (MWD) of LLPE, LDPE, and HDPE before versus after biodegradation by \( T. molitor \) and \( T. obscurus \) larvae (Fig. S2) indicated clearly that the MWD of LLDPE and HDPE moved toward high molecular weight while MWD of LDPE moved toward low molecular weight, supporting limited extent depolymerization of LLPE and HDPE and broad depolymerization of LDPE MPs.

Based on depolymerization or changes in \( M_{\mathrm{n}} \), \( M_{\mathrm{s}} \), \( M_{\mathrm{s}} \), PDI, and \( M_{\mathrm{s}} \), the biodegradation of the three PE polymers in \( T. molitor \) and \( T. obscurus larvae \) was similar. It was clear that biodegradation of LDPE was performed via broad depolymerization, showing significant reduction of \( M_{\mathrm{n}} \), \( M_{\mathrm{s}} \), and \( M_{\mathrm{s}} \) and suggesting more rapid depolymerization of LDPE than LLDPE and HDPE. LLDPE and HDPE polymers showed limited extent depolymerization with increased \( M_{\mathrm{n}} \) and \( M_{\mathrm{s}} \) as well as increased \( M_{\mathrm{s}} \) or unchanged \( M_{\mathrm{s}} \). The LDPE depolymerization/degradation extent appeared to be much greater than that of LLDPE and HDPE.

In this study, the crystallinity degree of LDPE, LLDPE, and HDPE was 48.0\%, 51.9\%, and 55.3\% (Table 1). The biodegradation of LDPE was more pronounced than that of the LLDPE and HDPE MPs, possibly due to the fact that compared to LDPE, HDPE and LLDPE consist of closely packed chains which results in a higher stability and crystallinity degree against degradation (Guadagno et al., 2001; Benítez et al., 2013). In this study, the crystallinity degree of HDP, LLDPE, and HDPE was 48\%, 51.9\%, and 55.3\%. LLDPE and HDPE are composed of linear chains with a very low level of short chain branching, and the molecules can stack and form strong intermolecular forces (Wagner and Lambert, 2018). LDPE, however, is characterized by a significant amount of long chain branching (typical branch length of several hundred carbon atoms) and short chain branching (length of 2 to 6 carbon atoms). These branching chains prevent tight packing into a crystalline structure (Wilkes and Aristilde, 2017), resulting in a lower crystallinity degree. LLDPE is a linear molecule with more short chain branching and less long chains when compared to HDPE (Guadagno et al., 2001). In this study, the crystallinity degree of the three PE did impact depolymerization extent.

Surface hydrophobicity is typically determined by the WCA of the surface (Restrepo-Flórez et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2014). WCA of the residual polymer samples from the frass of \( T. molitor \) larvae fed with LDPE, LLDPE, and HDPE were 87.7 \pm 1.5\(^{\circ}\), 91.5 \pm 1.3\(^{\circ}\) and 99.5 \pm 1.3\(^{\circ}\) (n = 3), respectively, while WCA of those from \( T. obscurus \) larvae fed with LDPE, LLDPE, and HDPE were 91.6 \pm 0.0\(^{\circ}\), 93.9 \pm 0.2\(^{\circ}\) and 100.0 \pm 1.4\(^{\circ}\) (n = 3), which was significantly lower than that of the 134.1 \pm 0.5\(^{\circ}\), 136.7 \pm 0.1\(^{\circ}\) and 133.0 \pm 0.0\(^{\circ}\) (n = 3) WCA of LDPE, LLDPE, and HDPE MPs, respectively. This observation indicated that the ingested PE MPs became less hydrophobic after passing through the digestive system of both Tenebrio species, and thus less resistant to enzymatic attacks or biodegradation (Sudhakar et al., 2008). Results obtained from the WCA indicated that the sequence of the decrease in WCA of the residual PE polymers was LDPE>LLDPE>HDPE (Fig. S3), demonstrating that the modification of surface property and PE degradation was significantly impacted by the three PE types. This is consistent with the reported results of abiotic degradation treatments, which indicated that the HDPE matrix was less efficiently degraded than the other two PE types (Fontanella et al., 2010).

GPC and WCA analyses demonstrated significant physical and chemical modification and structure change after LDPE, LLDPE, and HDPE MPs passed through the digestive systems of both Tenebrio species. The depolymerization and biodegradation extent was impacted by PE polymer types with a sequence of LDPE>LLDPE>HDPE.

\subsection*{3.2. Oxidation and chemical modification of LDPE, LLDPE, and HDPE}

The oxidation of the three PE types in the two Tenebrio species was characterized by FTIR analysis and confirmed biodegradation of the three PE MPs by both mealworms (Fig. 1B1-B3). In comparison with their corresponding controls, the intensity increase was found at several low-intensity bands located in the region of 1100-1300 cm \({ }^{-1}\), which represents stretching

Depolymerization/biodegradation of the six PE MPs was characterized using HT-GPC to determine molecular weights of the residual polymers in frass compared to the virgin PE MPs (Fig. 3). For \( T\). molitor larvae fed with three LDPE MPs, the residual polymers showed a significant decrease \((p<0.05)\) in \( M_{\mathrm{n}}\) (44.44\%, 83.13\%, and 96.59\%), \( M_{\mathrm{w}}\) (47.62\%, 88.13\%, and 52.34\%), and \( M_{\mathrm{c}}\) (51.00\%, 91.16 and 23.52\%) compared to the virgin polymers (Table 2 and S3). For \( T\). obscurus larvae fed with the three LDPE MPs, similar reduction was observed \((p<0.05)\) in \( M_{\mathrm{n}}\) (41.67\%, 81.25\%, and 97.75\%), \( M_{\mathrm{w}}\) (39.29\%, 87.81\%, and 84.08\%), and \( M_{\mathrm{c}}\) (39.00\%, 91.34\%, and 11.54\%) (Table 2), indicating that significant depolymerization of LDPE occurred within the gut of both species. After biodegradation, the residual polymers of LDPE \(_{640}\) and LDPE \(_{6400}\) diets in the frass excretion had \( M_{\mathrm{n}}\) of 0.42 and 0.6 kDa, and \( M_{\mathrm{w}}\) of 0.51 and 0.78 kDa, respectively (Table S3). Furthermore, the PDI \(\left(M_{\mathrm{w}} / M_{\mathrm{n}}\right.\) ratio) of LDPE \(_{102000}\) polymers significantly \((p<0.05)\) increased from a high value of 8.28 to 115.68 and 58.62 for frass excretions from \( T\). molitor and \( T\). obscurus larvae, respectively (Table 2), indicating rapid decomposing polymers with widely distributed molecular weights.

Significant differences \((p<0.05)\) were found between the depolymerization and biodegradation of HDPE versus that of LDPE by \( T\). molitor and \( T\). obscurus larvae (Fig. 3B1-B3). For HDPE \(_{62000}\), the reductions in \( M_{\mathrm{n}}\), \( M_{\mathrm{w}}\), and \( M_{\mathrm{c}}\) were 35.52\%, 66.35\%, and 82.25\% for \( T\). molitor, while similar results were obtained by \( T\). obscurus larvae (33.88\%, 64.42\%, and 80.72\%, respectively). For the HDPE \(_{105000}\) and HDPE \(_{132700}\)-fed groups, \( M_{\mathrm{w}}\) and \( M_{\mathrm{c}}\) of the residual polymers were significantly increased in both \( T\). enebrio species (Table 2 and S3). This indicated that these two HDPE MP s were biodegraded via limited extent depolymerization, as observed previously during LDPE degradation in the presence of antibiotic depression (Yang et al., 2021a, 2021c). These results suggested that when HDPE MP s with molecular weights higher than 100.0 kDa were fed to the larvae, the lower molecular weight fractions were degraded more rapidly than the longer chains, resulting in the accumulation of higher molecular weight fractions in the residual polymers. Furthermore, we compared the molecular weight changes of HDPE \(_{105000}\) versus LDPE \(_{102000}\) and found that the residual fraction of former increased \( M_{\mathrm{n}}\) by 407.69\% and 432.69\%, and \( M_{\mathrm{w}}\) by 16.76\% and 12.67\%, while LDPE \(_{102000}\) showed a decrease in \( M_{\mathrm{n}}\) by 96.59\% and 97.75\% and in \( M_{\mathrm{w}}\) by 52.34\% and 84.08\%. This indicated that depolymerization of the HDPE MP s was much less efficient than that of LDPE MP s with a similar molecular weight. Overall, the results of the HDPE \(_{105000}\)-fed \( T\). molitor and \( T\). obscurus groups revealed that the lower molecular weight fraction was degraded more rapidly than the longer chain polymers, resulting in an accumulation of residual polymers with higher molecular weight. For example, the \( M_{\mathrm{n}}\) of residual HDPE polymers was increased by 407.69\% and 432.69\% in \( M_{\mathrm{n}}\) while \( M_{\mathrm{w}}\) was 16.76\% and 12.67\% in the HDPE \(_{105000}\)-fed \( T\). molitor and \( T\). obscurus groups, respectively. Significant decreases \((p<0.05)\) in the \( M_{\mathrm{w}} / M_{\mathrm{n}}\) ratio from a value of 10.10 to 2.32 and 2.14 for polymers extracted from frass of \( T\). molitor larvae and \( T\). obscurus larvae (Table 2 and S2) further demonstrated the presence of low molecular weight oligomers in frass as a result of the biodegradation by gut microbiota in the digestive system of the mealworms. The HT-GPC analysis of the residual polymers from mealworms fed with PE of similar molecular weights but of a different type (HDPE \(_{105000}\) and HDPE \(_{102000}\) ) further revealed that LDPE is more readily biodegraded by gut microbes of mealworms than HDPE, which is consistent with the results on biodegradation of different types of PE microplastics observed in Fig. 1A1-A3.

\subsection*{3.4. Relative dominance analysis}

To examine the biodegradation performance of three PE types with different molecular weights, the variance analysis upon three PE types (LLDPE, LDPE, and HDPE) in \( M_{\mathrm{n}}\) reduction, \( M_{\mathrm{w}}\) reduction, and \( M_{\mathrm{c}}\) reduction was depicted in Fig. 4A. This reduction in \( M_{\mathrm{n}}\) was significantly associated with a change in the three PE types \((p=0.0285<0.05\); Fig. 4A1). Similarly, the reductions in \( M_{\mathrm{w}}(p=0.007<0.05\); Fig. 4A2) and \( M_{\mathrm{c}}(p=0.0014<0.05\); Fig. 4A3) were not significantly associated with a significant
