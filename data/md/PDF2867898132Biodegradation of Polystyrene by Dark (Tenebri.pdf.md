# Biodegradation of Polystyrene by Dark (Tenebrio obscurus) and Yellow (Tenebrio molitor) Mealworms (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae)

## Abstract
Yellow mealworms (larvae of Tenebrio molitor, Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) have been proven to be capable of biodegrading polystyrene (PS) products. Using four geographic sources, we found that dark mealworms (larvae of Tenebrio obscurus) ate PS as well. We subsequently tested T. obscurus from Shandong, China for PS degradation capability. Our results demonstrated the ability for PS degradation within the gut of T. obscurus at greater rates than T. molitor. With expanded PS foam as the sole diet, the specific PS consumption rates for T. obscurus and T. molitor at similar sizes (2.0 cm, 62-64 mg per larva) were 32.44 ± 0.51 and 24.30 ± 1.34 mg 100 larvae^-1 d^-1, respectively. After 31 days, the molecular weight (Mw) of residual PS in frass (excrement) of T. obscurus decreased by 26.03%, remarkably higher than that of T. molitor (11.67%). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) indicated formation of functional groups of intermediates and chemical modification. Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) suggested that T. obscurus larvae degraded PS effectively based on the proportion of PS residue. Co-fed corn flour to T. obscurus and wheat bran to T. molitor increased total PS consumption by 11.6% and 15.2%, respectively. Antibiotic gentamicin almost completely inhibited PS depolymerization. High-throughput sequencing revealed significant shifts in the gut microbial community in both Tenebrio species that were associated with the PS diet and PS biodegradation, with changes in three predominant families (Enterobacteriaceae, Spiroplasmataceae, and Enterococcaceae). The results indicate that PS biodegradability may be ubiquitous within the Tenebrio genus which could provide a bioresource for plastic waste biodegradation.

## Introduction
Plastic wastes have become a global environmental concern, with over 299 million tons of petroleum-based synthetic plastics industrially produced worldwide every year. \cite{1,2,3,4,5,6,7} Recently, microplastic particles (i.e., particle diameter <5 mm) have become an emerging environmental concern, as they have been found contaminating rivers, lakes, oceans, and wastewater treatment plants. \cite{8,9,10,11,12,13} Polystyrene (PS), [-CH-(C6H5)CH2-]n, is one of the major sources of plastic products in the world, with an annual production rate exceeding 20 million tons per year. \cite{14} Due to their high durability, plasticity, and corrosion resistance, PS products are widely used in packing, building, and food processing industries in forms of expanded PS (EPS), trade name Styrofoam, and as extruded PS (XPS). Due to its high prevalence in daily life, PS has become a major pollutant of soils, rivers, lakes, and oceans and is a source of microplastics. \cite{15,16,17}

Biodegradation of plastic wastes, including that of PS, has been studied since the 1960s. \cite{18,19,20,21,22,23} Researchers have attempted to use mixed microbial cultures and isolated bacteria from various sources such as soil, garbage, or sewage sludge to biodegrade PS into low molecular organics or mineralize to CO2. \cite{24,25,26,27,28} However, the efficiency of PS biodegradation by microorganisms or enzymes varied because of the persistent macromolecular structure of the plastics and was still quite low

\section*{MATERIALS AND METHODS}

\section*{Mealworm Sources and Feedstock.} In this study, \(T\). obscurus larvae (approximately 2 cm in length) purchased from Zaozhuang Insects Breeding Plant, Shandong, and \(T\). molitor larvae (approximately 2 cm in length) purchased from Binzhou Insects Breeding Plant, Shandong, China, were utilized for PS biodegradation tests. Additional \(T\). obscurus larvae were purchased to evaluate their ability to eat and chew PS foam from one U.S.A. source, Rocky Mountain Mealworms, Colorado, as well as from two sources in China: Guanyuan Insects Breeding Plant, Sichuan, and Luoyang Insects Breeding Plant, Henan (Figure S1).

The larvae for both species were identified based on morphology and coloration (Figure 1) as described by Robinson (2005) and Calmont and Soldati (2008). \({ }^{31,32}\) Larvae of both species were not fed with any antibiotics according to suppliers. Prior to the tests, \(T\). molitor larvae were fed with a normal diet of wheat bran while \(T\). obscurus was fed with a normal diet of corn flour. Elementary ratios of C:H:O:N:S (w/ w) were 35.7:6.5:41.5:2.7:0.5 for bran and 38.5:7.4:48.0:1.2:0.3 for corn flour. Both diets provide sufficient nutrients as well as a source of carbon for mealworm growth.

Expanded PS foam (or Styrofoam as commercial name) was used as feedstock for the larvae of both species and was purchased from Lan Tian Plastic Company, Guangdong, China. The PS feedstock contained polystyrene purity over 96.3\%. Number-average molecular weight \(\left(M_{n}\right)\) of the PS was 107000 and weight-average molecular weight \(\left(M_{w}\right)\) was 345000 with a density of 0.0197 \pm 0.0009 g/cm \({ }^{3}\) and a water angle of 104.2 \pm 2.1 \({ }^{\circ}\). No extra additives or catalysts were added, according to the manufacturer. According to our analysis, the bromide content in the PS foam was under the detection limit (<1 mg g \({ }^{-1}\) ), indicating that there are no brominated flame retardants in it. The tetrahydrofuran (THF, GC grade purity \(\geq 99.9 \%\) ), gentamicin sulfate, and trypticase soy agar (TSA) were purchased from Aladdin, Shanghai, China.

\section*{Mealworm Survival Rates and Biodegradation of PS.} To compare the PS consumption and biodegradation between the larvae of the two species, six treatments were prepared based on feeding conditions: starvation of \(T\). molitor, PS-fed \(T\). molitor, PS plus bran-fed \(T\). molitor, starvation of \(T\). obscurus, PS-fed \(T\). obscurus, and PS plus corn flour-fed \(T\). obscurus. Wheat bran or corn flour can provide sufficient nutrients for their growth. For each treatment, initial larvae (410) were randomly selected and placed in a food grade polypropylene container (volume of 3300 mL) under controlled conditions \((25 \pm 1{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, 70 \pm 5 \%\) humidity, and dark environment). To assess PS consuming capacity initially, PS blocks (7.2 g) were added. Co-diet treatments were PS plus bran (1.2 g) for \(T\). molitor larvae and PS plus corn flour (1.2 g) for \(T\). obscurus larvae. An additional 1.2 g of the codiet was supplemented every 5 days to reach a final ratio of PS to codiet of 1.0:1.0 at the end of test. This ratio was the same to that previously used to test the effect of the codiet on PE and PS degradation in \(T\). molitor larvae. \({ }^{35}\) Prior to the test, larvae were fed their regular food for at least 3 days, then they were fasted for 1 day, and finally were fed with respective feedstocks.

The measurement of survival rates and plastic mass loss was carried out every 5 days and ended on day 31. We selected a 31 day period to avoid pupation, and a high survival rate of \(T\). molitor larvae could be maintained within 4-5 weeks with PS as the only diet. \({ }^{34}\) During the measurement time, dead larvae and molted exoskeletons were removed from containers to prevent their being eaten by the remaining larvae since cannibalism existed in the later period. \({ }^{33}\) All treatments were conducted in duplicate.

\section*{THF Extraction.} THF extraction was used to determine the mass of PS residue in frass during the test period as described previously. \({ }^{34,35}\) The egested frass contained an extractable part and a nonextractable part; the extractable part consisted of the undigested PS polymer and modified PS polymers, while the nonextractable part consisted of other residues, such as undigested exoskeletons. \({ }^{34,35}\) After being dried at ambient temperature, frass samples (0.5 g) were extracted with 10 mL of THF for 3 h with a magnetic stirrer. Then, the extracted THF solution was filtered with a 0.22 \(\mu \mathrm{m}\) poly(ether sulfone) (PES) membrane filter and collected in a preweighed glass vial. After evaporation, polymer residue in the vial was weighed to calculate the mass of THF-extracted polymer. \({ }^{35}\) All THF extraction tests were conducted in triplicate.

The THF extractable ratio (TER) was used as an indicator of PS biodegradation or digestion in larval guts and was calculated on the basis of the weight of extracted polymer divided by the weight of the sample for THF extraction. \({ }^{34}\) PS feedstock showed 100\% while TER of frass depended on the content of residual or not-degraded PS.

\section*{Frass Collection and Analytical Methods.} To obtain enough frass for characterization, additional larvae (approximately 2000 for each group) were raised as described above. Likewise, mass of PS and codiet were increased proportionately. At the end of the 31 day test, larvae were cleansed by streamed air and transferred to a clean iron container to collect frass within 24 h. The collected frass was immediately stored at \(-20{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) for final characterization. The morphology of frass of PS-fed \(T\). molitor and \(T\). obscurus larvae was observed by SEM-EDX (SI M2, Figures S3 and S4).

Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) (Agilent 1260, Agilent Technologies Inc., U.S.A.) was applied to analyze changes of molecular weight of the polymer. Preparation of samples was similar to THF extraction test described previously. PS was extracted from PS feedstock (1.0 g) and frass samples (1.0 g) from PS-fed larvae by THF. After filtration, the THF solution was mixed on a magnetic stirrer with gentle heating (60 \({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) ). After the extracted solution was concentrated to 5 mL in volume, the extract (20 \(\mu \mathrm{L}\) in volume) was injected into the GPC analyzer, with a flow rate of 0.8 mL/ min. \({ }^{1,34,35}\)

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (Nicolet iS5 FTIR Spectrometer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, U.S.A.) was applied to characterize major functional groups of PS feedstock sample and frass in the range of 4000-500 cm \({ }^{-1}\). Prior to the analyses, samples were dried in a freeze drier for at least 36 h and then ground with KBr to prepare a homogeneous KBr pellet for scanning. \({ }^{1,32-34}\)


Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) (TA-Q500, TA Instruments, U.S.A.) was applied to characterize thermal changes from PS to frass. The heating program included two different atmospheres so as to study pyrolysis of the sample under a nitrogen and air ambiances, respectively. Samples (5 mg) were heated from 40 to 800 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min under a high-purity nitrogen ambiance (99.999%), then cooled to 500 °C, and finally heated again to 800 °C under an air ambiance.

Antibiotic Suppression Test. The effect of antibiotic suppression on PS depolymerization and degradation was tested using T. obscurus larvae with gentamicin as an inhibitor. Gentamicin was selected based on previous results. \({ }^{32,33}\) The gentamicin suppressive group (410 larvae) was fed antibiotic feedstock (AF) containing corn flour versus gentamicin sulfate at 100:3 (w/w) for 3 days and then fed with PS feedstock. AF was continuously fed with PS feedstock and resupplied every 3 days. On day 15, frass samples from the antibiotics treatment were collected to analyze for the molecular weights using GPC.

On day 0 (prior to feeding PS), 7, and 15, 15 T. obscurus larvae were randomly chosen from each source of larval populations to prepare a gut suspension for counting of gut microorganisms. The larvae were decontaminated by 80% ethanol, rinsed by Milli-Q water, and anotomized to obtain the guts. Subsequently, gut contents were extracted and suspended in 5 mL sterile saline water, serial diluted (10 \({ }^{-1}\) to \(10^{-7}\) ), and cultivated on nonselective TSA plates at \(37{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) for \(24 \mathrm{~h}\). Finally, the number of colonies were counted as described elsewhere. \({ }^{33}\)

Microbial Community Analysis. Larvae used for microbial community analysis were collected from PS-fed T. obscurus and PS-fed T. molitor treatments at day 0, day 6, and day 11 for microbial community analysis. The DNA extraction and PCR amplification methods were similar to that reported previously and are detailed in Supporting Information (SI M3).

Phasing amplicon sequencing was applied to sequence the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Purified amplicons were paired-end sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Sequencing data was demultiplexed, quality-filtered on Trimmomatic, and merged according to criteria. \({ }^{46}\) Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) were clustered with 0.97 identity threshold using UPARSE. \({ }^{47}\) Chimeric sequences were identified and removed using UCHIME. Taxonomy of each 16S rRNA gene sequence was analyzed by RDP Classifier against the Silva 16S rRNA database with a confidence threshold of 70\%. Finally, microbial community composition, hierarchical cluster analysis, principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), and ternary analysis were run on the free online platform of the Majorbio I-Sanger Cloud Platform (Shanghai, China).

\section*{RESULTS AND DISCUSSION}

PS Consumption of T. obscurus vs T. molitor larvae. All T. obscurus larvae purchased from Shandong, Sichuan and Henan Provinces, China and Colorado, U.S.A. chewed and ate PS foam (Figures 1 and S1). We surmise that the chewing and ingestion of PS foam is likely an adaptive behavior intrinsic to T. obscurus. They behaved similarly to each other but

| Mealworm source | Initial weight, mg larva⁻¹ | Feed | Weight change (\%) at the end of test | Survival rate \% | mg PS 100 larvae⁻¹ d⁻¹ | mg PS g larva⁻¹ d⁻¹ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| \( T. obscurus \) | 66.15 ± 2.13 | PS+C | +15.9 ± 4.1 | 94.9 ± 1.7 | 39.24 ± 1.73 | 5.94 ± 0.26 |
| | | PS | −8.1 ± 3.7 | 91.5 ± 1.5 | 32.44 ± 0.51 | 5.06 ± 0.08 |
| | | Unfed | −13.2 ± 2.7 | 67.6 ± 2.2 | nd | nd |
| \( T. molitor \) | 62.41 ± 1.72 | PS+B | +14.6 ± 1.8 | 93.2 ± 1.0 | 33.23 ± 0.80 | 5.33 ± 0.13 |
| | | PS | −8.6 ± 1.2 | 89.3 ± 2.7 | 24.30 ± 1.34 | 3.89 ± 0.47 |
| | | Unfed | −18.2 ± 6.0 | 62.0 ± 2.9 | nd | nd |

*Specific PS consumption rates were calculated on the basis of the mass of PS consumed over the test period (31 days). PS = polystyrene; C = corn flour; B = bran; nd = not determined. Test temperature was at 25 °C.*

The larvae of \( T. obscurus \) were less sensitive to light and spread themselves on the foam surface or penetrated the inside matrix (Figure 1a,c). The \( T. obscurus \) larvae purchased from Shandong, China were selected for further study because of stable supply. The PS consumption by both species increased progressively (Figure 2a). The \( T. obscurus \) were capable of rapid PS consumption at rates which were even greater than those of \( T. molitor \). During the 31 day test with PS as the only diet, the PS mass consumption by the \( T. obscurus \) larvae was 55.4% ± 1.5% while that by \( T. molitor \) was 41.5% ± 3.0% (Figure 2a). The PS consumption increased when codiets were added, i.e., the \( T. obscurus \) consumed 67.1% ± 1.8% of PS and \( T. molitor \) consumed 56.8% ± 1.9%. The specific rate of PS consumption was calculated as the amount of ingested PS per day for 100 mealworms based on the mass loss of PS foam, and as average numbers of survived mealworms.

At the end of the 31 day test at 25 °C, the survival rates (SRs) of both species fed EPS alone were 91.5 ± 1.5% and 89.3 ± 2.7%, respectively, significantly greater than those of unfed controls (67.6 ± 2.2% and 62.0 ± 2.9%) (Table 1) and not significantly less than corn flour-fed and bran-fed larvae (95.0 ± 1.7% and 93.2 ± 1.0%) (Table 1 and Figure 2b). Over the 31 day test period, starved larvae of both species lost 13.2 ± 2.7% and 18.2 ± 6.0% of their average weights, respectively. As expected, the larvae of \( T. obscurus \) and \( T. molitor \) fed with PS alone lost their average weight slightly by 8.1 ± 3.7% and 8.6 ± 1.2%, respectively, while those fed with corn flour and bran experienced a 15.9 ± 4.1% and 14.6 ± 1.8% weight gain, respectively (Table 1). As expected, the survival rates of both starvation species were much lower than those fed with PS only and PS plus codiet (corn flour or bran) at the end of the 31 day period, as observed previously with \( T. molitor \). The \( T. obscurus \) larvae showed slightly better survival than \( T. molitor \) (Figure 2b). The observation supported the fact that the addition of the nutrition-rich codiet enhances PS consumption by both species. When PS was applied as the sole diet, the higher SRs and slight decrease in average weights of both species indicated that larvae received their energy source from digestion of PS but lacked a nutrition source for their growth, as observed previously.

The specific PS consumption rates (SPCRs) were calculated for days 0 to 10, 11 to 20, and 21 to 31 (Figure 2c) and for the overall 31 day period (Figure 2c inset). Overall, \( T. obscurus \) larvae exhibited comparatively greater PS consumption ability than \( T. molitor \), i.e., 32.44 ± 0.51 versus 24.30 ± 1.34 mg 100 worms⁻¹ d⁻¹ fed with PS only and 39.24 ± 1.73 versus 33.23 ± 0.80 mg 100 worms⁻¹ d⁻¹ when codiet corn flour and bran were fed, respectively (Table 1). The rates are within the rate ranges of 12 \( T. molitor \) larvae collected from China, U.S.A., and UK, i.e., 8.5–21 mg 100 worms⁻¹ d⁻¹ for \( T. molitor \) fed with PS only and 24–46 mg 100 worms⁻¹ d⁻¹ for the worms fed with PS plus codiet. The results also confirmed that higher SPCR can be achieved in \( T. obscurus \) when the nutrition-rich codiet is supplied, as reported with the tests with \( T. molitor \). The results of this study also showed that SPCRs were increased during the initial 21 days and then declined (Figure 2c). Further research is needed to understand whether this was due to maturation of the larvae or other unknown reasons.

Change of TER, i.e., THF extractable ratio (which represents the fraction of residual PS polymer in egested frass), can indirectly indicate the change of PS degradability in mealworm gut. The TER of frass from both species (Figure 2d) fed with PS only decreased during the 31 day test from 57.8% ± 4.1% and 65.2% ± 2.3% on day 6 progressively and finally stabilized at 27.3% ± 1.7% and 32.4% ± 0.7%, respectively, a value that was significantly different (p < 0.01). The decrease of TERs during the 31 day period indicated that PS degradation and then mineralization in the gut of larvae increased gradually, likely due to an increase in PS-degrading microbial activities. In addition, the final TER of the frass of \( T. obscurus \) was significantly lower than that of \( T. molitor \) (p < 0.01). Therefore, we concluded that \( T. obscurus \) was superior to \( T. molitor \) for PS biodegradability.

Biodegradability and Evidence of Depolymerization. GPC analysis was conducted at the end of the 31 day test to characterize the depolymerization and biodegradation of ingested PS using the established methods. Frass samples from the \( T. obscurus \) fed with PS only contained polymer extracts with \( M_n \) values that were 26.0% lower than the feedstock and \( M_w \) values that were 59.2% lower than the feedstock (PS feedstock with \( M_n \) of 107000; \( M_w \) of 345000). Frass samples from \( T. molitor \) had \( M_n \) values that were 11.7% lower and \( M_w \) values that were 29.8% lower than the feedstock (Figure 3a). These decreases in \( M_n \) and \( M_w \) were significant for all sources (t test, p < 0.05), indicating depolymerization and degradation of PS feedstock was ubiquitous

study is needed to identify these compounds and PS degraded intermediates.

Evidence of oxidation and depolymerization of the PS polymer was also obtained using FTIR analysis at the end of the 31 day test. A comparison of FTIR spectra for the PS feed stock sample and egested frass of both species showed chemical changes and incorporation of oxygen previously linked to plastic degradation (Figure 3b). The FTIR data with appearance of carbonyl groups are similar to the data showing PS biodegradation in \(T\). molitor larvae previously reported. \({ }^{1,32-35}\) The spectra of frass from \(T\). obscurus fed with PS and PS plus corn flour were similar to those from \(T\). molitor fed with PS and PS plus bran and were significantly different from the frass of unfed \(T\). obscurus and PS feedstock (Figure 3b). Peaks at 625-970 cm \(\left.{ }^{-1}\right)\) (ring-bending vibration) had high intensities in the PS feedstock but were much weaker in frass samples of both species, indicating a decrease of PS polymer in frass samples. Peaks characteristic of the PS benzene ring \(\left(\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{C}\right.\) stretch, 1550-1610 and 1800-2000 \(\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\) ) were dampened in frass of larvae fed PS or PS plus corn flour or bran, suggesting ring cleavage. In the frass from \(T\). obscurus fed PS, new functional groups were observed, i.e., peaks at 1075-1150 \(\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\left(-\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{O}-\right), 1650 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}\left(-\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{C}-\right.\) stretch), and 1700 \(\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\left(-\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O}\right.\) stretch), suggesting that the oxidation and depolymerization processes of PS which occurred in \(T\). obscurus were the same as those occurring in \(T\). molitor. The addition of the oxygen functional groups into the polymer chain was considered as the preliminary and key step in plastic degradation in previous studies. \({ }^{25,48}\) Moreover, the broad peaks at about 3440 \(\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\) were assigned to hydroxyl or carboxylic acid groups. This suggested that the surface had a change from a hydrophobic to a more hydrophilic property. FTIR analysis confirmed that all frass samples showed strong signs of PS biodegradation, as observed in previous tests of \(T\). molitor from Beijing, \({ }^{1}\) a California PetCo store, \({ }^{34}\) plus 12 other larval populations around the world, \({ }^{33}\) and demonstrated the depolymerization and biodegradation capabilities of \(T\). obscurus tested in this study.

Thermal modifications of ingested PS were detected using TGA at the end of the 31 day test. As shown in Figure 3c, only one maximum decomposition rate (about \(435{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) ) was detected in the PS sample. In contrast, for frass from \(T\). obscurus fed PS only (PS D) and from \(T\). molitor (PS Y), four maximum decomposition rates (three under a \(\mathrm{N}_{2}\) ambience and one under an air ambience) appeared at about 92.74, 341.86, 438.74, and 509.79 \({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\), respectively (Figure 3c). The decomposed part under \(100{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) was possibly classified as volatile organics (gut secretion, carboxylic acid compounds from PS biodegradation, etc.) while decomposed parts from 100 to \(360{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) might be attributed to other biological wastes and biodegradation residue. The frass from both species decomposed in same way, suggesting the production of new organic intermediates with different thermal properties in the guts of the larvae. \({ }^{1}\) The mass loss ratio of the frass of \(T\). obscurus larvae in the stage of 360 to \(480{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) was 35.15\% while that of \(T\). molitor larvae was 41.03\%, in comparison with the PS feedstock of 96.32\%. This result implied that the PS polymer structure deteriorated as it passed through the guts and that more PS was depleted or biodegraded in \(T\). obscurus, suggesting that larvae of \(T\). obscurus were more efficient in PS biodegradation than the larvae of \(T\). molitor.

\section*{Antibiotics Suppression Test.} A gentamicin suppression test was performed to identify the role of gut bacteria in \(T\). obscurus in PS biodegradation. The number of gut bacteria in \(T\). obscurus larvae receiving gentamicin sharply decreased from \(0.86 \times 10^{8}\) to \(5.7 \times 10^{8}\) and \(4.4 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{CFU}\) per gut by almost two to three magnitudes after receiving gentamycin for 7 or 15 days. Meanwhile, the controls without antibiotics remained unchanged at the level near \(10^{7} \mathrm{CFU}\) per gut (Figure S5 and Table S4), implying that the gut bacteria were effectively suppressed by gentamicin sulfate. On day 15, the frass was collected for GPC analysis. The \(M_{w}\) and \(M_{n}\) values were basically unchanged (Figure 3a), demonstrating that PS depolymerization was almost completely inhibited in the presence of gentamicin. When gut bacteria were inhibited, the \(T\). obscurus completely lost the capacity of PS depolymerization and thus, biodegradation. This was similar to observations where PS depolymerization and then biodegradation by \(T\).

as gut eco-physiology. After ingesting PS, there was a decrease in microbial community diversity in \(T\). obscurus but an increase for \(T\). molitor (Figure S6a). This change of microbial structure was investigated using Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) at the OTU level (Figure S6b). The microbial community structure for both species approached similarity on day 11.

On the basis of relative abundance, the gut microbiome of these two Tenebrio species mainly consisted of 17 families (Figure 4a). Spiroplasmataceae, Enterococcaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, and Streptococcaceae are the dominant families. After PS feeding, community shift was mainly associated with the distribution of Spiroplasmataceae, Enterococcaceae, and Enterobacteriaceae. For instance, the ingestion of PS resulted in the relative abundance increase of Enterobacteriaceae in \(T\). obscurus from 2.09\% to 29.21\% and 20.52\% on day 6 and day 11, respectively. Meanwhile, the Enterobacteriaceae reached relatively higher abundance more quickly in \(T\). obscurus than in \(T\). molitor. Previous work by Brandon et al. (2018) found that Citrobacter sp. and Kosakonia sp., which were demonstrated strongly, associated with PE and PS degradation by \(T\). molitor and belonged to the family Enterobacteriaceae. \({ }^{35}\) Furthermore, PE degrading Enterobacter absurcis YT1 isolated from the gut of the Indian meal moth (larvae of Plodia interpunctella) also belonged to the family Enterobacteriaceae. \({ }^{51}\) The increase in the Enterobacteriaceae likely related to the development of PS-degrading microbes. The results suggest that the gut microbial community of \(T\). obscurus shifted to that of high PS degradation capacity compared to \(T\). molitor. The relative abundances of the families of Spiroplasmataceae and Enterococcaceae also changed noticeably in both species, which are known gut-associated bacteria in the Tenebrio gut microbiome. \({ }^{52,53}\) A ternary analysis suggested that the families Enterococcaceae, Spiroplasmataceae, and Enterobacteriaceae were strongly associated with the PS diet in \(T\). obscurus (Figure S7), which was consistent with the result in relative abundance distributions.

To further compare differences in gut microbial communities of both species, hierarchical clustered heatmap analysis was conducted at the genus level (Figure 4b). \({ }^{54,55}\) As Figure 4b shows, four clusters were generated from six samples: Cluster I (Dark-11 and Yellow-11), Cluster II (Yellow-1 and Yellow-6), Cluster III (Dark 6), and Cluster IV (Dark 1). Among the four clusters, microbial communities in Cluster I exhibited high similarities, implying a homology of microbial community structure in both species that were fed PS after 11 days. However, Cluster III and Cluster I were separated from Cluster IV, which further verified that the ingestion of PS could shift the gut microbial structure, and \(T\). obscurus were more adapted to the PS diet. Further study will address the key functional microorganisms which play an essential role in PS depolymerization and their synergistic relation with Tenebrio larvae if it is present.

Implications. This work is the first report to demonstrate that PS, one of the most highly persistent plastics, can be depolymerized and undergoes chemical modifications within the gut of larvae of \(T\). obscurus. We demonstrated for the first time that not only \(T\). molitor but also \(T\). obscurus may have ubiquitous capabilities to degrade PS, which supports our hypothesis that the ability of insects to depolymerize PS and other plastics is not restricted to \(T\). molitor. \({ }^{32,33}\) In this study, \(T\). obscurus larvae from sources in China and the U.S.A. exhibited an ability to chew and ingest PS; the selected \(T\). obscurus larvae for PS degradation tests demonstrated higher consumption rates and depolymerization extents than \(T\). molitor larvae. Although further investigation of other sources of \(T\). obscurus is needed to provide supplementary convincing evidence and mechanisms of the ubiquity of PS biodegradation in the family members belonging to darkling beetles (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), the larvae of \(T\). obscurus and \(T\). molitor are likely candidates of plastics-degrading organisms. Our work revealed that the PS biodegradability of the Tenebrio genus members is gut microbe dependent, suggesting that a plastic-degrading ecosystem exists and/or has been under development via bioactivities on multiple levels. Future work is also needed to confirm whether \(T\). obscurus has the capacity to degrade other common plastics such as PE, PP, PVC, and PET as well as to confirm the mechanisms and pathways of such biodegradation. At present, it is still difficult to imagine that mealworms could be utilized directly for a solution toward the global crisis of plastic pollution. Since the gut microbiome of the larvae is the key in biodegradation, more research should be done on replicating the gut process and conditions through bacterial cultures. More efforts in scientific research based on our studies and our findings on the degradation abilities of the Tenebrio genus could inspire a technological approach to solve the problems of plastic waste and microplastic pollution.
