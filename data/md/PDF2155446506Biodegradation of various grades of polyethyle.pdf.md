### Abstract

Polyethylene (PE) is the most productive plastic product and includes three major polymers including high-density polyethylene (HDPE), linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) variation in the PE depends on the branching of the polymer chain and its crystallinity. *Tenebrio obscurus* and *Tenebrio molitor* larvae biodegrade PE. We subsequently tested larval physiology, gut microbiome, oxidative stress, and PE degradation capability and degradation products under high-purity HDPE, LLDPE, and LDPE powders (<300 \(\mu \mathrm{m}\) ) diets for 21 days at \(65 \pm 5 \%\) humidity and \(25 \pm 0.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\). Our results demonstrated the specific PE consumption rates by *T. molitor* was 8.04–8.73 mg PE \(\bullet 100\) larvae \({ }^{-1} \cdot\) day \({ }^{-1}\) and by *T. obscurus* was 7.68–9.31 for LLDPE and HDPE, respectively. The larvae digested nearly 40\% of the ingested three PE and showed similar survival rates and weight changes but their fat content decreased by 30–50\% over 21-day period. All the PE-fed groups exhibited adverse effects, such as increased benzoquinone concentrations, intestinal tissue damage and elevated oxidative stress indicators, compared with bran-fed control. In the current study, the digestive tract or gut microbiome exhibited a high level of adaptability to PE exposure, altering the width of the gut microbial ecological niche and community diversity, revealing notable correlations between *Tenebrio* species and the physical and chemical properties (PCPs) of PE-MPs, with the gut microbiome and molecular weight change due to biodegradation. An ecotoxicological simulation by T.E.S.T. confirmed that PE degradation products were little ecotoxic to *Daphnia magna* and *Rattus norvegicus* providing important novel insights for future investigations into the environmentally-friendly approach of insect-mediated biodegradation of persistent plastics.

## Introduction

Polyethylene (PE) is a synthetic polymer derived from petroleum and is widely used in the production of plastics, accounting for 26.3\% of global production of 400.3 million tonnes (PlasticsEurope, 2024). The accumulation and pollution of waste PE products have become a significant environmental or public health problem, attracting widespread attention in the fields of solid waste management and environmental toxicology (Ding et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022a). Low-density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE), are the major products of PE (Wilkes and Aristilde, 2017). HDPE has long linear chains with minimal or no branching and a high degree of crystallinity (60–80\%). LLDPE has a medium crystallinity range of 20–60\% (Kong et al., 2003). It is composed of linear molecules with more short chain branching than HDPE (Ojeda et al., 2011a). Its crystallinity is low, ranging from 40 to 50\% (Yu et al., 2014). LDPE, on the other hand, has a high quantity of long chain branching, with an average branch length of several hundred carbon atoms, as well as small chain branching that is 2–6 carbon atoms long. According to Yang et al. (2022), the physical properties of different polymers make them suitable for various applications and also affect their degradability in different environments, i.e.,

LDPE degrades faster than LLDPE and HDPE.

Disposal of plastics, including landfilling, mechanical recycling, and incineration, has several drawbacks and limitations for plastic waste management. Since the 1970s, the biodegradation of PE products, particularly LDPE, has been investigated using microorganisms from diverse environmental sources, including sludge, soil, landfill, seawater, and compost (Ghatge et al., 2020; Restrepo-Florez et al., 2014; Ru et al., 2020). The results of the study indicate that PE is resistant to biodegradation, with a half-life that can range from weeks to months or even years (Shah et al., 2008). Biodegradation of PE in natural environments is believed to occur only after thermal or photo-oxidation (Lambert and Wagner, 2017; Shah et al., 2008). Previous studies using microbial cultures and enzymes have also shown that the biodegradability of PE polymers is influenced by the physical properties (PCPs) of the polymers, such as molecular weight, long and short-chain branching, C-atom number of polymer chains, hydrophobicity, and crystallinity, etc. (Ojeda et al., 2011b; Wilkes and Aristilde, 2017; Yang et al., 2022a). A study by Chieillini et al. (2003) demonstrated a 50% reduction in mass of PE materials with a molecular weight of less than 1.5 kDa over a period of 120 days due to microbial degradation. However, for higher molecular weight PE, it took more than two months for a PE-degrading Enterobacter asburiae YT1 and Bacillus sp. YP1 to degrade about 6.5% and 11.3% of commercial LDPE film with a molecular weight of 88.2 and Mn of 27.7 kDa (Yang et al., 2014). “Biodegradation” is a term that refers to the degradation of a substance by enzymes present in living organisms, primarily through microbial activities. This process involves the decomposition of organic matter, as described in Wikipedia. Biodegradation of persistent plastics is an attractive solution due to its cost effectiveness and environmental friendliness (Sanchez-Hernandez, 2021). This process can be carried out either on-site or through natural mechanisms, making it the most favourable method for environmental remediation. Although “biodegradation” is traditionally associated with microbial degradation, it has also been employed to refer to degradation facilitated by insects.

To date, since 2015, T. molitor fed PS styrofoam with number average molecular weights (Mn) of 40,430 and weight average molecular weights (Mw) of 124,200 as a sole diet by Yang et al. (2015a), 47.7% of the ingested styrofoam carbon was converted into CO2 within 16 days, researchers have been attracted to using insects to degrade plastic polymers. Reports of insect biodegradation of plastics have focused primarily on the larvae of Tenebrio. Molitor, T. obscurus, and Zophobas atratus (Tenebrionidae) (Robinson, 2005), and Galleria mellonella (Pyralidae), probably and partially, due to their high commercial availability, and chew, ingest and biodegrade plastic at rates on an hourly basis. Biodegradation of LDPE and PS were the main plastics targeted by Tenebrionidae in these studies (Brandon et al., 2018; Peng et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2015a, 2015b, 2021a, 2021c). They also biodegrade PVC, PP and PUR (Luo et al., 2021; Peng et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2021b). Additionally, the insects belonging to Lepidoptera, Pyralidae moths also showed biodegradation of PE, including G. mellonella (Bombelli et al., 2017; Kong et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2014), Indian meal moth Plodia interpunctella (Yang et al., 2014), Achroia grisella (Kundungal et al., 2019) and Spodoptera frugiperda (Zhang et al., 2022b).

Both T. molitor and T. obscurus larvae are not only two widely investigated plastic-degrading insect larvae (Wu and Cridde, 2021; Yang et al., 2023b), but also are commercially reared for animal feed and insect protein, typically being fed with wheat bran (WB) (Ding et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2021c). Our previous work has shown that both species can rapidly biodegrade LDPE, LLDPE and HDPE (Yang et al., 2021c, 2022). Studies of LDPE biodegradation by these two species have demonstrated that under nutrient-poor conditions, coordination of gut microbiome carbon and nitrogen metabolism is necessary for energy and nutrition acquisition during plastic degradation (Ding et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023a). Although T. molitor and T. obscurus have distinct behaviours (Peng et al., 2019; Robinson, 2005), both species can adapt to LDPE diets by altering their gut microbiota or microbiome structure (Dai et al., 2022; Welti et al., 2020) to ensure their capacity to survive using PE as their sole source of both energy and carbon within a 3–5 week period (Lou et al., 2020, 2021; Przemieniecki et al., 2020; Woo et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2021a, 2021b, 2021c, 2022). Previous research on reported that a decrease in gut microbial community similarity occurs after larvae switch to a plastic-based diet, such as LDPE, PS, and etc. (Brandon et al., 2018; Peng et al., 2019, 2021; Przemieniecki et al., 2020; Ruiz Barrionuevo et al., 2022a, 2022b; Yang et al., 2022, Yang et al., 2023a). However, the majority of reports on microbiomes associated with PE degradation by insect larvae have focused on LDPE (Brandon et al., 2018; Peng et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2021c).

During plastics biodegradation, Tenebrio larvae are directly exposed to PE microplastics (MPs), through biofragmentation of ingested plastic foams or particles into fragments by chewing, grinding, and digestion in the gut. Studies on other macroinvertebrates have shown that long-term exposure to MPs can cause biological toxicity, causing mechanical damage and the onset of inflammatory responses in Corbicula fluminea, mice and zebrafish (Li et al., 2021).The gut is a vital line of defence against exogenous substances, as well as being an essential organ for immunity, digestion and absorption in insects. When the gut microbiota becomes imbalanced or are mechanically stimulated, various inflammatory and immune cells are activated, leading to intestinal inflammation (Baeckhed et al., 2005; Li et al., 2021; Suzuki et al., 2004). However, the extent to which gut health reflects the effects of PE-MPs with different PCPs on Tenebrio larvae during plastic degradation, has not been clearly elucidated. Our previous studies found that different metabolic intermediates were generated when T. molitor and T. obscurus larvae ingested and digested HDPE, LLDPE and LDPE. The degradation intermediates formed may also affect on T. obscurus and T. molitor larvae.

For more than a decade, PE has been the top plastic in the world, and it is a promising sustainable technology and green strategy to utilize the mealworms, which are macroinvertebrates with the ability to degrade plastics, in the biodegradation of PE. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have comprehensively addressed the comparison of the impacts of PE type (LDPE, LLDPE and HDPE) on larval physiology, gut microbiome and oxidative stress (at a physiological or biochemical level). In addition, in the long run, the larvae degrade microplastics and then excrete plastic into the ecosystem, and it is important to investigate whether their frass contain toxic substances that are harmful to aquatic and terrestrial organisms in

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Sources of Tenebrio larvae

T. molitor larvae were procured from the Dafa Birds and Flower Market in Harbin, China while T. obscurus larvae were procured from a Breeding Farm in Zaozhuang, Shandong, China. The dealers claimed that the larvae were fed a diet without antibiotics.

2.2. PE materials

The high-purity PE powders (size: <300 μm) of LDPE, HDPE, and LLDPE were purchased from Shanghai Plastics Trading Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China. The molecular weights are Mn 42.2, 93.2, and 59.5 kDa; Mw 110.5, 222.5, and 182 kDa; and size averaged molecular weight (Mz) 216.1, 456.5, and 408.8 kDa for LDPE, LLDPE, and HDPE, respectively (Table S1). No catalysts or additives were present according to manufacture (Table S2). Wheat bran (WB) was purchase from an agricultural market in Harbin, China. All analytical grade chemicals used for analyses were analytical degrade from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., Beijing, China, were all utilized in the studies. Beijing Aoboxing Bio-Tech Co., Ltd provided the agar.

2.3. Biodegradation tests

Biodegradation of HDPE, LLDPE and LDPE by T. obscurus and T. molitor larvae were performed. To allow the larvae to naturally and effectively ingest and biodegrade the MP particles, the respective PE powders were mixed with agar (0.9:25, w/w) as an adhesive. This method has been previously used and reported in studies by Cappellozza et al. (2019); Peng et al. (2021); Yang et al. (2022). The larvae of T. molitor and T. obscurus were fed with high-purity HDPE, LLDPE, and LDPE powders (25 g) mixed with agar (DI Water 30 ml, 3%, w/w) compared to agar with WB as the control diet. Prior to starting the experimental diets, all tested larvae were starved for 48 h to empty their guts. Initially, 7g of food was provided to T. obscurus and T. molitor larvae in 1000 ml food-grade rigid polypropylene incubators. Food freedom was ensured during the experiment, and each incubator contained 400 larvae. The experiments were conducted in triplicate. The larvae fed with WB served as the control group. To prevent cannibalism, dead mealworms were immediately removed. (Ding et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2019). All larval incubators were kept in an artificial climate chamber (250L in volume) (Artificial climate incubator, Shanghai Shuli, Shanghai, China) for 21 days at 65 ± 5% humidity and 25 ± 0.5 °C.

Every seven days throughout the experimental period, the number of live and dead larvae in each group was counted to determine the larval survival rates (SRs) (Peng et al., 2021; Wu and Cridde, 2021; Yang et al., 2021c). The average weight of larvae was determined. Both species were fed WB for two weeks, although corn flour is the preferred food of T. obscurus (Ding et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2019b). A detailed description of the diet fed to Tenebrio larvae is available in the supporting information (SI M1 and Table S3).

2.4. Measurement of PE particles

PE-MPs present in the Tenebrio larvae frass were extracted using a Fenton system (Qin et al., 2015) combined with an olive oil-based extraction method (Scopetani et al., 2020)developed based on previous reports after the frass material was ground using a pestle and dried (Yang et al., 2021c). More details is available in the supporting information (SI M2 and Figs. S1–2).

2.5. Analytical methods

The molecular weight values (Mw, Mn, and Mz) of the virgin and residual PE-MPs were ascertained by high-temperature gel permeation chromatography (HT-GPC) (PL-GPC 220, Agilent Technologies, Inc., USA) analysis, respectively. It should be noted that the reduction in molecular weight (%) is shown as a positive value; thus, an increase in molecular weight corresponds to a negative value.

Using a Nicolet iS50 FTIR Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, U. S.A.), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was utilized to identify the primary functional groups of virgin PE-MPs compared to frass residues following transit through the digestive system. Furthermore, the PE-MPs' oxidation was evaluated using the Carbonyl index (CI), which was computed in accordance with Lessa Belone et al. (2021); Prata et al. (2019). For LDPE, LLDPE, and HDPE, the intensity of the carbonyl peak (C=O) in the range of 1715–1735 cm−1 was divided by the intensity of 1471 cm−1 (as a reference peak).

Using a Bruker Avance 600 MHz NMR spectrometer (Bruker Corporation, Germany) for proton nuclear magnetic resonance and an Agilent GC/MS instrument (7890B–5977 B GC/MS from Agilent Technologies, USA) in conjunction with a PY-3030D pyrolyzer unit (EGA/PY-3030D, Frontier, Japan) from Frontier Laboratories for Pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). All analytical procedures are described in detail in the supporting information (SI M2) and were performed according to established methods for characterizing plastic biodegradation, as documented in previous publications (Brandon et al., 2018; Wu and Cridde, 2021; Yang et al., 2022). Each analysis was performed in triplicate to ensure reliability.

2.6. Determination of biomass composition

At the end of the test period (day 21), 50 larvae from each test group were euthanized by low temperature (−80 °C) lyophilization (LGJ-12F, Foring Science Instrument Technology Development Co., Ltd., Beijing, China), then crushed and mixed under liquid nitrogen conditions. Subsequently, the larval biomass was collected for use in the determination of biomass nutrient concentration levels. The total concentrations of carbohydrates (food safety testing standard GB/T 15,672-2009), crude fats (GB 5009.6–2016), crude proteins (GB/T 6433-2006) and benzo-quinones were determined in triplicate in order to determine the physiologic indexes for larvae. GC-MS analysis was performed to determine the fatty acid content (GB 5009.168–2016) of every exposure group. The Cys content was determined using a Cys assay kit (YX-W-A905) from Sinobestbio Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). A microplate reader (FlexA-200, ALLSHENG, Hangzhou, China) (600 nm absorbance) was used to measure the concentration. A detailed description of the analytical methods used is provided in the SI (M1) (Peng et al., 2019, 2022; Zielinska et al., 2021).

2.7. 16S rRNA gene sequencing

The gut tissues and its contents of 20 randomly selected larvae were collected from each group at the end of the 21 day test period for microbial community analysis. Samples were rinsed twice with 8.5% NaCl after decontamination by immersion in 75% ethanol for 1–2 min to obtain the gut tissue. Before being used, all samples were preserved in sterile freeze-storage tube and kept at −80 °C. Whole samples were sent to Shanghai Majorbio Bio-Pharm Technology Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China) for microbial community analysis, with a detailed description of the DNA extraction and PCR amplification methods used provided in the SI (M2). Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) were identified from the sequencing results by clustering sequences with an identity threshold of 0.97 using UPARSE (v. 11). Chimeric sequences were identified and deleted using FLASH (v. 1.2.11). The Silva 138 16S rRNA database was used to analyse the taxonomy of each 16S rRNA gene sequence by the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier (v.

Relative generic abundance, diet and host-specificity metadata (e.g., larvae source or species) and PE-MP PCPs were used for the Abund Jaccard distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) using R package (v. 3.3.1). Variation partitioning analysis (VPA) (R vegan package) was used to determine the explanatory value (%) for significant response variables, such as larval diet and larval species.

Partial least squares square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was performed using SmartPLS3 software with the following variables: Tenebrio species (T. molitor versus T. obscurus), microbiome (based on diet related genus abundances and host-specificity), and the PCPs of PE-MPs (WCAs, PE type, Mn, Mw, Mz and crystallinity degree). The relationship between variables was defined by the path coefficients. The statistical goodness of fit (GOF) was used to select the target model from all the created models, based on the models overall predictive power (Jiao et al., 2018; Wagg et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2020).

The analysis of differentially expressed genes based on weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) have been powerful, effective, and widely used methods to explore relationships between genes (Núria et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2020). These methods have successfully uncovered characteristic genes in key pathways and identified functional gene clusters with co-regulated profiles. This allows for the construction of an accurate network of hub genes and environmental traits by focusing on gene expression datasets and microarray analysis. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and WGCNA (SI M3) analyses were combined to screen for hub KEGG Orthology (KO) enrichment (based on the Tax4Fun2 program on the online Majorbio Cloud Platform and R v. 4.2.3) corresponding to metabolism (Ren et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2021).

To establish whether oxidative stress and damage could be induced by PE MPs in Tenebrio larvae, which have been shown previously to have a high capacity for plastic biodegradation, the levels of T-AOC, SOD and MDA were determined in larvae at the end of the test period (day 21). All experimental procedures followed the manufacturer's instructions (SI M4). In addition, single larva was randomly selected from each group and fixed in 4% (v/v) formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, then sectioned (4 μm thickness) and finally stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) prior to microscopic examination. Finally, degradation intermediates/compounds of three types of PE were evaluated through QSR prediction using T.E.S.T. to estimate their acute oral toxicity (LD50) in Rattus norvegicus and Daphnia magna (48 h LC50) as well as their potential for developmental toxicity.

ANOVA analysis was carried out to assess the differences in SRs, AWCRs and microbial diversity. To evaluate variations due to diet and species, the Student's t-test was conducted with Tukey's correction. All reported p-values were adjusted and error values were expressed as the average value ± standard deviation. Statistical analysis was conducted using Origin (v. 2022b).

\section*{3. Results and discussion}

\subsection*{3.1. Biodegradation of PE-MPs in T. molitor and T. obscurus larvae}

Both T. molitor and T. obscurus larvae consumed all three types of PE polymers. At the end of the test, the SPECR by T. molitor were \(8.26 \pm 0.28,8.73 \pm 0.19\), and \(8.04 \pm 0.06 \mathrm{mg} \mathrm{PE} \bullet 100\) larvae \({ }^{-1} \mathrm{day}^{-1}\) for LDPE, LLDPE and HDPE, respectively. The residual PE polymer contents in the frass on day 21 were \(52.23 \pm 7.22 \%\), \(59.17 \pm 12.16 \%\), and \(68.72 \pm 8.96 \%\) for LDPE, LLDPE and HDPE, respectively. The SPECR of T. obscurus larvae were \(9.31 \pm 0.35,8.03 \pm 0.08\), and \(7.68 \pm 0.13 \mathrm{mg}\) PE \(\bullet 100\) larvae \({ }^{-1} \mathrm{day}^{-1}\) for LDPE, LLDPE and HDPE, respectively, with respective residual PE contents in the frass of \(51.82 \pm 8.45 \%, 62.00 \pm 5.25 \%\), and \(64.52 \pm 14.65 \%\) (Table 1). The results indicated that the larvae of both species showed biodegradability as LDPE > LLDPE > HDPE.

The numbers of T. molitor and T. obscurus larvae fed with PE polymers in all groups decreased over test period. The SRs of both T. molitor fed with PE were lower than those of Controls fed with bran with an order of WB > LDPE > HDPE > LLDPE (Fig. 1A and Table 1). The SRs of T. obscurus larvae in each group were not significantly different, and WB diet group was slightly lower than that of the PE diet group, suggesting that the PE plastic diet did not cause a decrease in the SRs of the larvae. No intact dead larvae were observed during the experiment. The larvae of the Tenebrio genus (e.g., T. molitor, T. obscurus and Z. atratus) have the innate behavior of cannibalism (Ding et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2021b, 2021c), and the reduced SR of the larvae in the present study was mainly caused by cannibalism of the larvae. In addition, at the end of the 21-day test, the larvae fed with WB had significantly higher AWCRs than those fed with PE polymers in both species of larvae (P < 0.01). This was expected due to the nutrition-rich WB diets enhancing the larval average weight (Fig. 1B and Table 1 and S3).

\subsection*{3.2. Verification of biodegradation}

The biodegradation/depolymerization of the three PE polymers was verified by changing in PE structures and oxidation of residual polymers. Molecular weight changes were observed as LDPE from the frass of T. obscurus and T. molitor larvae with decreasing of Mn from 93.2 to 67.6 versus 69, Mw from 222.5 to 158.9 versus 162.4, and Mz from 456.5 to 306.5 versus 315 kDa; while LLDPE with increasing of Mn from 42.2 to 71.6 versus 82.2, Mw from 110.5 to 179.2 versus 193.5, and Mz from 216.1 to 361.1 versus 379.1 kDa. In addition, the residual HDPE's molecular weight (Mn and Mw) was increased, i.e., Mn from 59.5 to 77.4 versus 80.8, Mw from 180.2 to 200.2 and 201.6 kDa, but Mz was remained almost unchanged (it reduced from 408.8 to 404.6 kDa and increased from 408.8 to 415.5 kDa, respectively). The three PE polymers biodegraded similarly in T. obscurus and T. molitor larvae, as shown by changes in Mn, Mw, and Mz or depolymerization. It was evident that LDPE depolymerized more rapidly than LLDPE and HDPE, and the extent of degradation appeared to be much more than that of HDPE and LLDPE (Table 1 and Figure S3A).

FTIR analyses showed formation of newly oxidative functional groups, i.e., stretching of C-O-C groups (1100-1300 cm \(\left.{ }^{-1}\right)\) carboxylic acids (1708-1698 cm \(\left.{ }^{-1}\right)\), ketones (1723-1713 cm \(\left.{ }^{-1}\right)\), aldehydes (1740-1733 cm \(\left.{ }^{-1}\right)\), and lactones (1786-1780 cm \(\

MPs polymers from the frass of \(T\). obscurus and \(T\). molitor larvae fed with PE powders increased obviously (Table 1, \(p<0.05\) ), i.e., LDPE increased by \(240.01 \pm 6.65 \%\) and \(365.40 \pm 14.97 \%\), HDPE increased by \(274.62 \pm 3.90 \%\) and \(554.59 \pm 5.87 \%\), and LLDPE increased by \(96.01 \pm 8.10 \%\) and \(78.94 \pm 7.36 \%\), respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 1C). Differences in the ability of both larvae to oxidize three different PE powders are similar to previously reported studies on the ability of \(T\). molitor and \(T\). obscurus to oxidize PS (Peng et al., 2019). In addition, \({ }^{1} \mathrm{H}\) NMR analysis further showed incorporation of oxygen (aminoic, carbonyl, aldehyde, methyl, and unsaturated allylic groups) and the breakdown of long chain PE polymers. Variations in \({ }^{1} \mathrm{H}\) NMR spectra between 1.4 and \(1.7 \mathrm{ppm}\) (Figure S3C) revealed that the frass samples from \(T\). molitor groups had more extra peaks than those from \(T\). obscurus groups. It implies that the two Tenebrio species' biodegradation processes are distinct from one another.

\subsection*{3.3. Organic compositions of the larvae}

Tenebrio larvae are increasingly being recognized as effective tools for plastic degradation and a value protein source for both livestock and humans. In particular, the Cys content of \(T\). obscurus is approximately 15.6-fold higher than that of \(T\). molitor (Ding et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023a). The nutritional composition of \(T\). obscurus and \(T\). molitor biomass is shown in Fig. 2 and Table 2. In terms of the total carbohydrate content of larvae at the end of the experimental period, no significant differences were observed in \(T\). obscurus groups. The larvae fed with LDPE had the highest total carbohydrate content (5.2 \(\pm 0.55 \%)\), which was significantly higher than the larvae fed with HDPE (3.88 \(\pm 0.54 \%\) ) or LLDPE (3.56 \(\pm 0.39 \%)(p<0.05)\), with all PE fed \(T\). molitor groups having a significantly higher carbohydrate content than the WB fed group (2.45 \(\pm 0.18 \%)\). Furthermore, under normal dietary conditions (WB-fed), the carbohydrate content of \(T\). obscurus (3.34 \(\pm 0.17 \%)\) was obviously higher than that of \(T\). molitor \((p<0.05)\), while the opposite

# Gut microbial community diversity and shift

16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to examine the gut microbiomes of both *Tenebrio* species fed respective three PE polymers (Figs. 3 and 4). The Simpson and Heip evenness diversity index values showed significant variation among all eight groups, with HDPE-fed larvae being less even, presumably due to the presence of dominant taxa (Fig. 3, A and S6). According to the Levins OTU abundance matrix, the niche breadth indicates the interactions of OTUs with their environment. The results

show that the intestinal flora of PE-fed mealworms was more generalized compared to that of the control groups (Fig. 3, B). A significant dissimilarity in microbial communities based on diet and species was evident through a PERMANOVA analysis utilizing Bray-Curtis dissimilarity ($p = 0.001$) (Fig. S7, Table S4).

The microbiomes of the larvae that were fed PE or WB diets exhibited distinct clusters for PE-fed and WB-fed larvae (Fig. 3, C and S8-9). In summary, feeding with PE-MPs enhanced diversity and changed the niche width of the larval gut microbiomes in both species (Luo et al., 2021). The niche widths of all PE-MP fed groups were higher than that of the WB group. The abundance of gut microbe species and ecological interactions within the gut communities in both Tenebrio species were affected by the varying nutrient supplies provided by LDPE, HDPE, LLDPE, and WB. High-nutrient environments can enhance competition between species in natural bacterial communities where collaboration and competition are prevalent (Dai et al., 2022; Engel and Moran, 2013; Nyholm and Graf, 2012; Palmer and Foster, 2022).

PE is a carbon-rich oligotrophic substance without any nitrogen source. The intestinal flora of Tenebrio larvae exhibited a strong capacity to adapt when larvae were fed PE-MPs as an energy and carbon source. Feeding with a PE diet likely added a selection pressure on the larvae due to their additional nutrient requirements, e.g., nitrogen source, leading to the development of a new microbiome adapted to a N-deficient environment (Fig. 3). This selection pressure adaptation resulted in the reduction of functional redundancy and an increase in resource utilization efficiency within the community. Another recent study by our team confirmed that when both species of mealworms consumed LDPE foam supplemented with their traditional diet, the gut flora with plastic-degrading functions played a more important role. However, nitrogen fixation by the gut flora, which was supplemented as a source of nitrogen, was diminished (Ding et al., 2023), while the study did not fully assess changes in biomass (fat, carbohydrate, protein, etc.) and oxidative stress in larvae on different diets.

\subsection*{3.5. Microbial community composition and sensitivity}

The assembly and structure of microbial communities depend on a combination of stochastic and deterministic ecological processes. Understanding gut microbial diversity and function requires consideration of these processes (Dini-Andreote et al., 2015; Jiao et al., 2020; Stegen et al., 2013; Tripathi et al., 2018). The degree of "heterogeneous selection" within the gut communities of all eight groups (LDPE-Y, LLDPE-Y, HDPE-Y, WB-Y, LDPE-D, LLDPE-D, HDPE-D and WB-D) was found to be 68\% in this study. Subsequently, RCBray was used to further partition the pairwise comparisons that were not assigned to selection ($|\beta \mathrm{JNTI}|<2$). Here the fractions of all pairwise comparisons, with \(|\beta \mathrm{NTI}|<2\) and \(|\mathrm{RCBray}|<0.95\), were used to estimate the influence of "undominated" assembly. In this study, the overall estimated influence of "undominated" assembly was 26\%, which mostly consisted of weak selection, weak dispersal, diversification and/or drift. Finally, the assembly with RCBray \(>0.95\) was considered to have 'dispersal limitation' and was estimated to be 6\% (Fig. 3, D). Deterministic ecological processes had a higher influence (68\%) than stochastic ecological processes, suggesting that microbial communities were mostly influenced by the host diet and species, or were not the result of a single dominant process (i.e., 'undominated' assembly).

The sensitivity of the gut microbiomes was assessed by comparing their responses to variables including host-specificity (Tenebrio species) and PCPs of PE-MPs (WCAs, PE type, Mn, Mw, Mz and crystallinity degree) (Fig. 3, E and S9-11, Tables S3-6). The compositional variability of the larval gut microbiome (n = 32) was significantly explained by Tenebrio species, based on dbRDA using a permutational ANOVA and VPA (Fig. S9, Table S5).

Overall, the PCPs of PE-MPs caused significant compositional variation (Tables S3 and 6and Fig. 3, E). Analysis of the gut microbiome using PLS-SEM revealed both direct and indirect effects of host-specificity (Tenebrio species) and the PCPs of PE-MPs on the microbiomes in both species, leading to depolymerization (Fig. 3, E and Table S6). The gut microbiome determines the change in PE molecular weight (Mw, Mn and Mz) or pathway of PE degradation. The path coefficients of the PCPs of PE-MPs were the highest, with the molecular weight of the original PE being the most influential among all tested properties. Molecular branching, weight distribution, and crystallinity degree followed, all of which had path coefficients greater than 0.9. The abundances of Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Achrobacter, Ralstonia, Glutamicibacter, Delftia, Ochrobactrum, Sphingomonas, Microbacterium and Staphylococcus were significantly associated with factors influencing gut microbiome assembly ($p<0.05$) and exhibited higher path coefficients (Fig. 3, E and S10). Overall, the goodness of fit (GOF) for Tenebrio species and PCPs of PE-MPs was 0.8088. Despite the model's relatively high predictive power, these findings suggest that there is still some unexplained variation, which is consistent with the VPA results.

Community similarity was assessed using Venn diagram analysis based on OTUs. The OTUs from all eight groups were compared (Fig. S11), revealing differences in the number of independent OTUs in different groups. 44 OTUs were shared between all groups, while 79 were shared only between \(T\). molitor groups (Fig. 4, A) and 55 were shared only between \(T\). obscurus groups (Fig. 4, B). For both \(T\). obscurus and \(T\). molitor groups, the number of shared OTUs in larvae fed with LDPE and LLDPE was higher than the number of shared OTUs in larvae fed with LDPE and HDPE or LLDPE and HDPE (Fig. 4, A and B). At the genus level, Unclassified-o-Enterobacteraceae, unclassified-f-Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus and Spiroplasma were the most common gut flora detected in both Tenebrio species across all treatments (Fig. 4, C). The relative abundances of these genera were lower in the WB-fed groups compared to the PE-fed groups. Acinetobacter was only present in the PE-fed groups of both Tenebrio species, with a stable relative abundance across all PE-fed \(T\). molitor groups (LDPE: 6\%, HDPE: 3\%, and LLDPE: 1\%), regardless of the PE-MPs PCPs. Stenotrophomonas were present in the LLDPE-D, LDPE-Y, and LLDPE-Y groups but were absent in the WB-fed larvae. Furthermore, the presence of Lactococcus, Spiroplasma, Citrobacter, Clostridium, Pseudomonas, Sphingobacterium, unclassified-f-Hafniaeae, and Massilia was observed in all PE-fed groups, but not in the WB-fed control groups. Therefore, based on taxonomic grouping, the microorganisms that specifically increased in the larval gut microbiomes were upregulated due to dietary conditions. The larvae of \(T\). obscurus contained a richer variety and high abundance of microorganisms related to nitrogen metabolism, i.e., Comamonas, Citrobacter, Actinobacteria (unclassified-c-Actinobacteria and Corynebacterium) (Chang et al., 2022), Acinetobacter, Ochrobactrum, Reyrenella(Xue et al., 2020), Enterococcus, Empedobacter(Mavriou et al., 2021), Oceanobacillus, Bacillus and Spiroplasma(Ding et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023a). In contrast, Massilia(Balazs et al., 2021), Reyrenella, unclassified-f-Enterobacteriaceae (Kampfer et al., 2005), Ochrobactrum, Solirubrobacter(Zhang and Zhao, 2019), Clostridium, Leuconostoc(Martinez-Rodriguez et al., 

This study identified differences in the intestinal microbial ecology, metabolic pathways, and microbial function of larvae fed with HDPE, LLDPE, LDPE or WB diets, were identified using the Functional Annotation of Prokaryotic Taxa (FAPROTAX) (Fig. S12). Both Tenebrio larvae showed enhanced gut microbiome functions associated with carbon and nitrogen metabolism after ingesting PE. These metabolic activities are crucial for plastic degradation by the larvae, as the plastic diet does not provide a nitrogen source for mealworms during the degradation of Nitrogen-free and carbon-rich PE polymer powders. These metabolic activities are crucial for plastic degradation by the larvae, as the plastic diet does not provide a nitrogen source for mealworms during the degradation of Nitrogen-free and carbon-rich PE polymer powders. Nitrogen is an essential element for protein and nucleic acid synthesis, as well as growth metabolism in insects. The gut microbiota of insects has

the potential to fix nitrogen biologically, which helps to maintain their nitrogen nutrition to a certain extent. Compared to a PE diet, the nitrogen nutrition in a wheat bran diet can largely meet the nitrogen requirements. This is evident in the following functions: aerobic chemoheterotrophy, nitrate respiration, nitrite respiration, nitrous oxide denitrification and denitrification, with the observed increase in function being significant for \(T\). obscurus larvae according to the Wilcoxon rank-sum test \((p<0.05)\). T. molitor larvae fed with PE-MPs exhibited a significant increase in aromatic compound degradation as compared to the WB fed group \((p<0.05)\), although chitinolysis was only significantly increased in the HDPE-Y group. This finding indicates that the Tenebrio gut flora adapted to the PE diet, by enhancing a variety of carbon and nitrogen metabolism processes. Carbon and nitrogen metabolism-associated ecological functions were richer and more significantly enhanced in \(T\). obscurus than in \(T\). molitor, possibly in order to balance higher protein requirements (Fig. 2, B and S4.B) (Peng et al., 2019). Under nitrogen-deficient conditions, aromatic compound degradation and chitinolysis played a more important role than aerobic chemoheterotrophy, nitrate respiration, nitrite respiration, nitrous oxide denitrification, or denitrification for \(T\). molitor, indicating that \(T\). molitor larvae preferred to assimilate chitin-rich exoskeletons to obtain nitrogen.

KO numbers are assigned genes based on the encoded function (Kanehisa et al., 2017) and the expression values of 8073 KOs from 32 larvae samples were used to build the co-expression module (see Fig. 5, A for cluster analysis results). The power value mainly influences the independence and average degree of connectivity of co-expression modules and when the value was 20, the independence degree reached 0.86 and the average connectivity degree reached 59.51. Overall, 11 distinct KO co-expression modules were obtained from the larval gut microbiome analyses, ranging from large to small according to the number of genes included. Interactions of the 11 co-expression modules were analyzed and eigengene dendrogram and heatmap analysis were used to distinguish between the groups of correlated eigen-genes. The blue modules in the dendrogram were closely related to the function of gut flora during plastic degradation in \(T\). obscurus, while turquoise was related to \(T\). molitor. Three modules (purple, brown and green-yellow) were significantly associated with changes in Mw, Mn and Mz (Fig. S13). The results of enrichment analysis for the identified modules show that a two-component system closely correlated with significant changes in the Mw, Mn and Mz of PE in both Tenebrio larvae (Fig. 5 B-F). This suggests that during the ingestion of PE, a two-component system is stimulated in larval gut flora to respond to the signal transduction and bacterial chemotaxis of different diets, leading to PE biodegradation. Furthermore, the significant enrichment of metabolic functions associated with energy and nutrient reserves further confirmed the observed transformation of fatty acids in all test larvae under different dietary conditions. This not only ensures the reproductive metabolism of microorganisms, but also promotes the biodegradation of persistent organics such as PE (Gao et al., 2016; Xue et al., 2023).

\subsection*{3.7. Oxidation stress and ecotoxicity}

After continuous feeding with PE-MPs powder for 21 days, the biochemical indices associated with oxidative stress were investigated, to determine whether they were induced by the ingestion and degradation of different PE types in \(T\). obscurus and \(T\). molitor. Among these, reduced enzyme synthesis altered assembly of enzyme subunits or even enzyme inactivation may lead to oxidative stress in larvae. SOD is an activated antioxidant enzyme that can scavenge excess peroxidative free radicals(Chen et al., 2020). T-AOC reflects the organism's overall level of protection against oxidative stress damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). The results showed that SOD and T-AOC contents of PE-fed mealworms showed a similar trend in both species: HDPE-Y/D > LLDPE-Y/D or LDPE-Y/D > Control-Y/D(Fig. 6 A-B). The MDA content of larvae of was also monitored to determine oxidative damage to membrane lipids(Peng et al., 2019), showing that the MDA content of larvae in all PE-fed groups was higher than in the WB-fed group. However, the MDA content trend varied according to species. \(T\). molitor exhibited a 2- to 3-fold higher MDA content in PE-fed groups than in the WB group, with the highest content of \(4.99 \pm 0.62 \mathrm{nmol} / \mathrm{g}\) fresh weight observed in the LLDPE-Y group, followed by HDPE-Y, LDPE-Y and Control-Y. In \(T\). obscurus, the MDA contents were ranked in the order: LLDPE-D (5.51 \(\pm 0.68)>L D P E-D\) (5.11 \(\pm 0.49)>H D P E-D\) (4.36 \(\pm 1.47)>C o n t r o l-D\) (4.06 \(\pm 0.60) \mathrm{nmol} / \mathrm{g}\) fresh weight. These results suggest that the PE of both larval species fed on different PCPs stimulates the antioxidant

Midgut pathological observation of \(T\). obscurus(C-F) and \(T\). molitor (G-J).}

This study reported the effects of three distinct polyethylene (PE) polymers i.e., LDPE, HDPE, and LLDPE on the gut microbiome, oxidative stress, and ecotoxicity after two major plastic-degrading Tenebrio larvae, T. obscurus and T. molitor, received these polymers as diets. Both T. obscurus and T. molitor larvae effectively biodegraded the three PE polymers via symbiotic reactions by the host larvae and gut microbiota. Both T. molitor and T. obscurus larvae biodegraded the three PE polymers effectively as a sequence of LDPE > LLDPE > HDPE. However, physiologically response and larval biomass developed were slightly different due to larval speciation.

Distinct differences in microbial diversities and gut microbial composition were observed among the two insect species and three PE polymers compared with WB-fed controls. T. molitor and T. obscurus larvae showed different oxidative stress responses and eco-toxicity to the three PE polymers. In general, the negative responses followed the order of HDPE > LLDPE > LDPE. Actinobacteria played an important role in the degradation of HDPE in both Tenebrio species larvae, and during the biodegradation of PE as the sole carbon/energy source. Nitrogen fixation functions were stimulated in the larval gut. The larvae maintained their activities by balancing carbon and nitrogen metabolism, utilizing carbohydrates, fats or proteins selectively depending on diet type and PE PCPs. Ingestion of a PE diet promoted the enrichment of microbial motility, metabolism, and signal transduction-related pathways (e.g. two-component systems, bacterial chemotaxis, carbon metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, and PTS), which are associated with enrichments in energy, material transfer and signal transduction pathways (e.g. amino acid biosynthesis, translocator proteins and PTS).

Furthermore, the stress responses induced by LDPE, HDPE and LLDPE biodegradation processes in Tenebrio larvae, demonstrate that residual MP particles caused oxidative stress and negative physiological responses. Importantly, due to the high plastic degradation capabilities of Tenebrio, the vast majority of plastic degradation products do not pose a serious threat to the health of vertebrates or invertebrates. These findings provide novel insights into our understanding of the role of the gut microbiome in plastic-degrading insects, microplastic-induced stress responses, tissue damage and toxic effects in invertebrates and vertebrates due to MP exposure and improve our understanding of the toxicity of MPs and NPs. There are similarities, but not identical ties, between the oxidative stress induced by PE microplastics on Tenebrio larvae and the physiological responses of macroinvertebrates without plastic degradability. Ingestion and biodegradation of poorly degradable LLDPE or HDPE plastic polymers caused a higher degree of impairment of physiological function and metabolism in invertebrates compared to the more biodegradable LDPE plastic polymers. Follow-up studies are needed to evaluate the larval damage degree of other difficult-to-degrade or degradable plastic polymers to gain a deeper understanding of the physiological and toxicity effects associated with micro- and nanoplastics on plastic-degrading functional invertebrates, as well as to explore degradation patterns that mitigate oxidative stress in model invertebrates with plastic-degrading capabilities.
