### ABSTRACT:
It remains unknown whether plastic-biodegrading macroinvertebrates generate microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) during the biodegradation of plastics. In this study, we utilized highly sensitive particle analyzers and pyrolyzer-gas chromatography mass spectrometry (Py-GCMS) to investigate the possibility of generating MPs and NPs in frass during the biodegradation of polystyrene (PS) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) foams by mealworms (Tenebrio molitor larvae). We also developed a digestive biofragmentation model to predict and unveil the fragmentation process of ingested plastics. The mealworms removed 77.3% of ingested PS and 71.1% of ingested PE over a 6-week test period. Biodegradation of both polymers was verified by the increase in the δ13C signature of residual plastics, changes in molecular weights, and the formation of new oxidative functional groups. MPs accumulated in the frass due to biofragmentation, with residual PS and PE exhibiting the maximum percentage by number at 2.75 and 7.27 μm, respectively. Nevertheless, NPs were not detected using a laser light scattering sizer with a detection limit of 10 nm and Py-GCMS analysis. The digestive biofragmentation model predicted that the ingested PS and PE were progressively size-reduced and rapidly biodegraded, indicating the shorter half-life the smaller plastic particles have. This study allayed concerns regarding the accumulation of NPs by plastic-degrading mealworms and provided critical insights into the factors controlling MP and NP generation during macroinvertebrate-mediated plastic biodegradation.

## INTRODUCTION
Microplastics (MPs, 10 μm to 5 mm) and nanoplastics (NPs, 1 to 1000 nm), derived from anthropogenic sources, now exist ubiquitously in the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere, with NPs further subdivided into nanosized plastics (1–100 nm) and submicron-MPs (100–1000 nm).1–7 Due to their unique properties, such as tiny size, large specific surface area, and high surface energy, MPs and NPs exhibit complex environmental behaviors and play a role in pollutant transport processes and biogeochemical cycling through multilateral interactions.8 Organisms in the aquatic and terrestrial environments are inevitably impacted by the MPs and NPs released from natural and anthropogenic sources. Researchers have elucidated the cell internalization of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) MPs (<80 μm) in the digestive system and their translocation to the bloodstream in the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis L).9 Cytomembrane penetration by NPs has also been found to cause physiological and metabolic disorders, as well as growth retardation in animals.3,10 At present, MPs and NPs are considered emerging particulate contaminants that pose a risk to human health through direct ingestion, inhalation, and accumulation in the human food web.1

Ingestion of plastic debris by macroinvertebrates is widely observed in the natural environment, resulting in MPs commonly found in a variety of animals. The concern of biofragmentation of plastics debris into MPs, MPs into NPs by macrofauna, especially macroinvertebrates, has been addressed.11 A study found that animal-based traditional medicinal materials contained polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) MPs.12 Burrowing invertebrates also induce fragmentation of mariculture polystyrene (PS) floats, leading

to the formation of MPs. \({ }^{13}\) The ingestion of plastics by macroinvertebrates is accompanied by biofragmentation behaviors via mouthparts and intestinal peristalsis, and smaller-sized plastic particles are typically generated. \({ }^{2,14-16}\) By microscopic observation, it was found that land snails (Achatina fulica) disintegrate and biofragment the ingested PS foam into PS MPs with a mean size of \(1.343 \pm 0.625 \mathrm{~mm} .{ }^{17}\) However, it remains unclear whether NPs were generated and accumulated as a result of the method limit for particle detection, while the snails are capable of biodegrading PS. After Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), which did not show PE biodegradation, ingested PE MPs (31.5 \(\mu \mathrm{m})\), the PE MPs were fragmented into smaller particles in their digestive gland, including NPs ranging from 150 to 500 nm. \({ }^{18}\) Freshwater amphipod Gammarus duebeni has been found to rapidly fragment PE MPs (10-45 \(\mu \mathrm{m}\) ) into a wide range of sizes, including NPs ranging from 558 nm to 1 \(\mu \mathrm{m}\), in digestive tracts. \({ }^{19}\) Earthworms (Eisenia andrei) exposed to two different sizes of PE MPs (180-212 \(\mu \mathrm{m}\) and 250-300 \(\mu \mathrm{m}\) ) for 21 days also generated NPs (180-364 nm) in their hindgut, which damaged the spermatogenesis and coelomocyte viability. \({ }^{20}\) Characterization of ingested MPs in earthworm Lumbricus terrestris (Oligochaeta) indicated that the earthworms fragmented and depolymerized (or biodegraded) biodegradable polyactic acid (PLA) MPs (300 \(\mu \mathrm{m}\) ) and fragmented poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) MPs (234 \(\mu \mathrm{m}\) ) and LDPE MPs (362 \(\mu \mathrm{m}\) ) into small-sized MPs (20-113 \(\mu \mathrm{m}\) ) without significant evidence supporting biodegradation. \({ }^{21}\) It remains unknown whether nanosized PLA and PBAT, both of which are biodegradable polymers, as well as LDPE particles, were generated. After ingestion by the aforementioned macroinvertebrates, these plastic fragments are excreted in the excrement (frass or fecula) and eventually enter ecosystems. \({ }^{22,23}\) Therefore, the digestive fragmentation of plastics by macroinvertebrates has been raised as a scientific concern. To date, research on the observation of NP generation and accumulation due to biofragmentation has primarily focused on targeted macroinvertebrates that lack plastic-degrading ability, such as Antarctic krill, earthworms, woodlice, and enchytraeids. Little is known about the digestive fragmentation behaviors of macroinvertebrates with exceptional plastic-degrading abilities during the biodegradation of plastics.

Recent studies have found that certain macroinvertebrates, especially insect larvae, are capable of the rapid biodegradation of plastics. Yellow mealworm, the larva of Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus 1758 (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) observed around the world and naturally present in forests with rotten wood, is one of the highly efficient plastic-degrading macroinvertebrates that voluntarily ingest a wide variety of petroleum-based plastic products, e.g., PS, low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polyurethane (PUR), PP, PVC, and PET. \({ }^{15,16,24-44}\) The unique metabolic process in the mealworm intestines endows them with great plastic-degrading capacities to depolymerize and biodegrade the ingested plastics through various gut-related mechanisms. After passing through the mealworm intestines, almost half of the ingested PS and LDPE can be efficiently biodegraded and mineralized within a short retention time of about 12 h, with residual polymers excreted in the frass. \({ }^{25,27-29,31,34,37,38,41,42,44-46}\) However, whether MPs or NPs are generated, retained, and accumulated as residues in the frass during the digestion of the plastics remains unknown. No detailed investigation has been conducted on the size distribution of residual micro- and nanosized particles in the previously published reports due to a lack of methods for characterizing, predicting, and unveiling the digestive formation of MPs and NPs during plastic biodegradation.

In this study, we investigated the digestive fragmentation of commercial PS and LDPE foams by mealworms to assess the in vivo fate of the ingested plastics and determine the size distribution of residual plastic particles generated after biodegradation. We used highly sensitive particle-analyzing methods, i.e., laser light scattering sizer and pyrolyzer-gas chromatography mass spectrometry (Py-GCMS), to assess the size distribution of residual plastic particles and the mass content of potential NPs in frass. Additionally, we developed a digestive biofragmentation model based on enzymatic surface degradation to simulate the size-reduction process of plastic particles in the intestinal tract and compared the simulated results to the data of residual plastic particles detected with the sizer. Not only did we confirm the biodegradation of both PS and LDPE foams, supported by plastic mass balance, \(\delta^{13} \mathrm{C}\) signature changes, chemical modifications, and molecular-weight changes, but also we accurately detected the size distribution of residual plastic particles. We found that all of the residual plastics observed were within the MP range (>2 \(\mu \mathrm{m}\) ) without NPs detected above the detection limit (>10 nm). Py-GCMS analyses showed negative results of NPs (<100 nm) in the frass. We simulated the size-reduction processes of the ingested PS and PE particles in the intestinal tract using the digestive biofragmentation model. The predicted results aligned with the analytical results, indicating ultrafast biodegradation of small-sized plastic particles by mealworms. This study provided technically sound methodologies to test the size distribution of micro(nano)plastics and predict the digestive biofragmentation processes during macroinvertebrate-mediated plastic biodegradation.

\section*{MATERIALS AND METHODS}

\section*{Source of Mealworms and Tested Plastic Feedstocks.}

Yellow mealworms (or T. molitor larvae) were purchased from Binzhou Mealworm Co. (Binzhou, Shandong, China) and shipped overnight to our laboratory. The mealworms were 5-6 instars, with an average weight of \(98.3 \pm 1.5 \mathrm{mg}\) (Table S1). The tested mealworms were not fed on any diets containing hormonal additives or antibiotics before, according to the dealer.

Expanded PS foam (density: 0.0207 g/cm \({ }^{3}\), CAS number: 9003-53-6) and LDPE foam (density: 0.0255 g/cm \({ }^{3}\), CAS number: 9002-88-4) were purchased from Zhonglian Petrochemical Co. (Guangdong, China) (Figures S1 and S2). The contents of 10 plasticizers commonly found in plastics were below the detection limits (<0.05 ppm, w/w), indicating that the PS and LDPE foams are free from major additives (Table S2). The PS polymers had the number-average molecular weight \(\left(M_{n}\right)\) of 106.3 \pm 2.9 kDa, the weight-average molecular weight \(\left(M_{w}\right)\) of 338.5 \pm 8.4 kDa, and the size-average molecular weight \(\left(M_{s}\right)\) of 838.9 \pm 39.8 kDa. The LDPE polymer had a \(M_{n}\) of 41.3 \pm 6.1 kDa, a \(M_{w}\) of 152.8 \pm 3.1 kDa, and a \(M_{s}\) of 453.9 \pm 9.9 kDa (Table S5). Both PS and PE fit the molecular weight range of commonly used plastic polymers (20 to 400 kDa). \({ }^{28,37}\)

Tetrahydrofuran (THF, GC grade purity > 99.9\%), ethanol (analytical grade), 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (1,2,4-TCB, GC grade purity > 99.

study were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corporation in Shanghai, China.

Plastic Feeding Test. The mealworms were bred in glass containers (15 cm × 15 cm × 6 cm) with smooth inner surfaces. Each container initially contained 100 mealworms (n = 3) with either PS or LDPE foam (4.0 g). The experimental procedures and conditions followed established protocols as described in previous research \({ }^{25,26,29,33-35,37,38,40,41}\), and 47. The molted exoskeletons of mealworms and dead larvae were removed from the container daily to prevent any potential intraspecific diseases. To calculate plastic consumption and mass reduction, frass samples of mealworms were collected weekly over a six-week period. The weekly frass collection procedures were implemented under identical incubation conditions and did not cause any significant adverse effects on mealworm larvae, which previously demonstrated their capability and stability in plastic biodegradation. \({ }^{35}\) All containers were maintained in a thermostatic incubator at a temperature of \(25 \pm 0.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) and \(70 \pm 5 \%\) humidity.

PS and PE Mass Balance and Removal. To determine the mass balance and removal of ingested plastics by the mealworms, sequential extraction of frass samples was applied to weekly determine the water-extracted fraction \(\left(C_{w}\right)\), ethanol-extracted fraction \(\left(C_{e}\right)\), and solvent-extracted fraction \(\left(C_{s}\right.\) THF for PS and 1,2,4-TCB for PE). The PS and PE removal was calculated based on the mass of plastics ingested by the mealworms, the mass of frass egested, and the residual polymer content in the frass (Text S1). \({ }^{15,30,36}\)

Analytical Methods for the Characterization of Plastic Biodegradation. The tested frass samples for characterizing PS and PE biodegradation were collected at the end of Week 6. At that time, the mealworms had reached the stable phase of plastic biodegradation. The mealworms were moved in separate clean glass containers overnight for frass collection as described previously.

Gel permeation chromatography (GPC, 1260 Infinity II GPC/SEC, Agilent Technologies Inc., U.S.A.) and high-temperature GPC (HT-GPC, 1260 Infinity II HT GPC, Agilent Technologies Inc., U.S.A.) analyses were conducted to determine the changes in the molecular weights \(\left(M_{w}, M_{n}\right.\), and \(\left.M_{v}\right)\) of the ingested PS and LDPE polymers after biodegradation versus the virgin polymers as described previously (Text S2). \({ }^{28,37}\) The polydispersity index (PDI) was calculated as PDI \(=M_{w} / M_{v}\). THF was used for PS extraction, and 1,2,4-TCB was used for PE extraction. All GPC analyses were performed in triplicate.

The \({ }^{13} \mathrm{C}\) stable isotope fraction in polymer samples was analyzed in order to identify the biodegradation of PS and LDPE foams. The elemental analyzer isotope ratio mass spectrometer (EA-IRMS, Vario EL cube-IsoPrime 100, Elementar, Germany) was employed to detect the modification of \({ }^{13} \mathrm{C}\) stable isotope signatures of the residual plastics from the frass versus the virgin plastic foam in delta \(\left(\delta^{13} \mathrm{C}\right)\) notation in parts per thousand (\%) as follows:

\[
\delta^{13} \mathrm{C}(\%)=\left[\frac{\left({ }^{13} \mathrm{C} /{ }^{12} \mathrm{C}\right)_{\text {sample }}}{\left({ }^{13} \mathrm{C} /{ }^{12} \mathrm{C}\right)_{\text {standard }}}-1\right] \times 1000
\]

The \(\delta^{13} \mathrm{C}\) value was calibrated by the international carbon isotope standard Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB). The overall precision of the \({ }^{13} \mathrm{C}\) measurement was \(\pm 0.20 \%\). The analysis methods were referred to in previously published literature and described in Text S3. \({ }^{48-50,73}\)

To characterize the chemical modification of the ingested PS and PE polymers after passing through the larval intestines, attenuated total reflection Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR, Bruker tensor 27 FTIR spectrometer, Bruker, Optik, Germany) was applied to evaluate the oxidation and biodegradation of the ingested polymers. \({ }^{48,51,52}\) Before the test, the frass sample was placed in a drying oven for 24 h to remove any residual water that could cause analytical errors. The sample was subsequently placed on a platform and flattened with a glass slide for scanning and graphing (4000- 500 cm \(\left.{ }^{-1}\right)\). OPUS software 7.0 (Bruker Optics, Germany) was used for processing the spectra.

Determination of Size Distribution and Examination of the Presence of Micro(nano)plastics. To determine the presence and size distribution of residual plastic particles belonging to micro- (>10 \(\mu \mathrm{m})\), submicro- (100 nm-10 \(\mu \mathrm{m})\), and nanoparticles (1 nm-100 nm) in mealworm frass, the frass sample (3.0 g) at the end of the 6-week experiment was first mixed with a 30\% \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}\) solution (wt/wt, 100 mL, specific gravity 1.1 g/mL) in a conical flask under gentle digesting (70 \({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) ) conditions for at least 12 h to thoroughly digest organic matter. We used the mealworm frass at the end of the 6-week experiment for analysis because the mealworms have reached the stabilization phase of PS and PE biodegradation since Week 4. After the supernatant became clear, the solution containing residual plastic particles was allowed to stand for 1 h. \({ }^{15,53,54}\) The solution containing residual plastic particles underwent filtration using a polyamide (PA) membrane filter (porosity: 100 nm, Yibo Filter Material Co., Zhejiang, China), which was the most suitable filter with the smallest available pore size. The micro- and submicroparticle particles with a size exceeding 100 nm on the filter membrane were meticulously collected and observed under high vacuum conditions using a scanning electron microscope (SEM; Phenom Pro, Phenom World Inc., Netherlands). The size distribution of the filtered micro- and submicroplastic particles was measured via the laser light scattering sizer (Mastersizer 3000, Malvern Panalytical, UK) based on the particular volume with a measurement range of 0.01-3500 \(\mu \mathrm{m}\) (Text S4). The accuracy of this method is better than the 0.6\% variable, with a repeatability rate of over 99.9\%. The relative particle percentage (RPP) or size distribution based on particle number was calculated by assuming that the particles were of spherical shape as follows

\[
\mathrm{RPP}=\frac{\mathrm{VD}}{4 / 3 \pi r^{3}} \times N
\]

where RPP is the relative particle percentage (\%); VD is the particular volume (\%); \(r\) is the radius; and \(N\) is the normalization coefficient.

To examine whether NPs (size <100 nm) were generated and accumulated in the frass, the filtrate was first evaporated to dryness in a crucible in the fume hood. After the filtrate was thoroughly dried, the solid residues of the filtrate were carefully collected. Finally, the plastic component in the solid residues (if any, size < 100 nm) was quantified by pyrolyzer-gas chromatography mass spectrometry (Py-GCMS, 7890B-S977B GC/MS, Agilent Technologies Inc., U.S.A.). The calibration standard curves for the PS and PE polymers (Figure S3) were obtained using PS and PE standard substances (Agilent Technologies Inc., U.S.A.). The Py-GCMS method is a well-

The frass samples from the mealworms fed with PS and LDPE foam were extracted by water, ethanol, and organic solvents (THF for PS and 1,2,4-TCB for LDPE).

\frac{d \gamma_i}{d t} = -\left(k_1 \times A_i^{\alpha} + k_2 \times \frac{1}{A_i^{\beta}}\right) \times \gamma_i
\]

\[
A_i = \frac{1}{R_i}
\]

where \(\frac{d \gamma_i}{d t}\) is the volume reduction rate of the plastic particles with particle size \(i\) at time \(t\) (h); \(k_1\) is the biodegradation rate constant of the plastics; \(k_2\) is the grinding rate constant of the plastics; \(A_i\) is the instant specific surface area of the plastic particles with particle size \(i\) (nm\(^2\)); \(\gamma_i\) is the quantity of the plastic particles; \(R_i\) is the diameter of the plastic particles with particle size \(i\) (nm); and \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are the correction coefficients.

Matrix Laboratory (MATLAB 2022a, MathWorks Inc., U.S.A.) was used to calibrate the kinetic parameters for the digestive biofragmentation model. Specifically, the genetic algorithm was used to optimize the parameters \(k_1\), \(k_2\), \(\alpha\), and \(\beta\) with a population size of 24. The steps of the evolution algorithm are 10,000, with a crossover probability of 0.8 and a mutation probability of 0.8, according to the protocols of the genetic algorithm. As shown in eq 5, the fitness function is the sum of the absolute deviations of the experimental values obtained from the measured size distribution and the calculated values:

\[
f = \sum_{i}^{85} \left| \gamma_i - \gamma_i^{\text{cal}} \right|
\]


The digestive biofragmentation model was then applied to simulate the time courses of the size-reduction process of PS and PE particles with different initial particle sizes (i.e., 350, 300, 250, 200, 100, and 50 μm) in order to predict the size-frequency distribution of the particles and the removal efficiency of plastics. The detailed methodology for modeling the digestive biofragmentation is documented in Text S5.

Statistics Analysis and Quality Control. The significant differences in the extraction rates, plastic removal, and \( M_{w}, M_{p} \), and \( M_{s} \) values were assessed by ANOVA and the student's \( t \) test with Tukey's correction. \({ }^{25,26,38}\) The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (K–S test) was applied to determine whether the size distributions of the two MPs were significantly different. The statistical analyses were conducted by using SPSS (IBM, version 26.0). The significance level was set at 0.05, with all \( p \)-values adjusted. The data are the mean ± standard deviations.

All experimental containers, vessels, and flasks were rinsed three times with Milli-Q ultrapure water and methanol (HPLC grade) to remove any potential background of micro- or nanoplastics. After thorough drying in the fume hood, the test materials and lab equipment were wrapped in aluminum foil and prepared for use. \({ }^{87,68}\) Before the filtration, Milli-Q ultrapure water was filtered through the membranes. The procedures of particle separation and identification were carried out in the fume hood in a dust-free clean room to prevent deviation caused by the indoor dust particles.

\section*{RESULTS AND DISCUSSION}

Mass Balance and Removal of the Ingested Plastics by Mealworms. The mealworms aggressively masticated and ingested both the PS and PE foams in the container (Figure 1a and 1b). The mass balance and removal of the ingested PS and PE plastics were monitored weekly based on the mass of the frass and residual plastic contents compared to the ingested plastics using the \( C_{w}, C_{p} \), and \( C_{o} \) values of the frass samples (Text S1). The average frass yield, an indirect indicator of digestibility, was 0.65, 0.62, 0.61, 0.65, 0.61, and 0.64 mg of frass/mg of PS for the PS-fed mealworms and 0.68, 0.68, 0.65, 0.66, 0.62, and 0.64 mg of frass/mg of LDPE for the PE-fed mealworms in weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively (Table S3), indicating that a significant amount of the ingested PS and LDPE polymers was digested and mineralized.

The results of the \( C_{w} \) values indicated that the frass from both PS-fed and LDPE-fed mealworms contained a relatively high level of water-extracted fraction, which increased gradually from 17.1 ± 2.1\% to 23.3 ± 0.7\% for the PS frass and from 15.3 ± 1.8\% to 23.3 ± 0.3\% for the PE frass over the 6 weeks, respectively (Figure 1c and 1d, Table S3). The \( C_{w} \) value represents the fraction of soluble organic components and salts in the frass. \({ }^{15,30}\) Therefore, the results implied that the ingested PS and LDPE foam were efficiently digested and hydrophilic soluble substances were generated. \({ }^{39,69}\) On the other hand, the water-extracted fraction of the frass samples both increased progressively during the first 4 weeks and stabilized after Week 4 (Figure 1c and 1d, Table S3). The results suggested that the plastic-degrading ability of the mealworms was induced by feeding them plastics and reached its peak in 3-4 weeks. This is likely due to the enhancement of plastic-degrading microbial activities or specific functional microbial consortiums in the intestines during the first 4 weeks, thereby reaching the full ability of the biodegradation and mineralization of plastics. The ethanol-extracted fraction (the \( C_{e} \) value), which was used to determine ethanol soluble intermediates in frass, was low in both PS and PE frass samples, varying between 1.5 ± 0.1\% and 2.5 ± 0.3\% (Figure 1c and 1d, Table S3). This indicated that the ethanol-extractable substances generated were limited during PS and PE biodegradation.

The organic solvent-extracted fraction (the \( C_{o} \) value) represents the content of residual PS (extracted by THF) or residual PE (extracted by 1, 2, 4-TCB) in frass. The \( C_{o} \) values of the PS frass and PE frass both decreased gradually during the first 4 weeks, i.e., from 58.6 ± 3.9\% to 38.5 ± 1.5\% and from 65.4 ± 2.4\% to 44.7 ± 1.2\% from Week 1 to Week 4, respectively, and then stabilized (Figure 1c and 1d, Table S3). The results indicated that the plastic degradation capacities of mealworms for both PS and LDPE increased and reached stable levels, resulting in the residual PS of less than 38.5\% and the residual PE of less than 44.7\% in the frass. This observation was similar to the changes in the THF extractable ratios of residual PS polymers during the PS biodegradation test by \( T\). molitor \({ }^{35}\) and \( T\). obscurus \({ }^{29}\) larvae.

Based on the results of the mass balance, the removal of PS and PE was calculated (Figure 1e and Table S3). Notably, the plastic removal or mass reduction was gradually increased from 61.9 ± 2.5\% to 78.2 ± 0.7\% for PS and from 55.5 ± 1.7\% to 73.2 ± 1.1\% for LDPE after Week 5. The results demonstrated that over 70\% of the ingested PS and LDPE polymers were effectively digested and structurally decomposed in the gut microenvironment of mealworms, which fell within the previously reported range. \({ }^{25,34}\)

Depolymerization of the Ingested Plastics. GPC analysis was applied to characterize the polymer depolymerization during biodegradation of the ingested plastics by insects. \({ }^{33,38,70}\) As shown in Figure 2a, significant changes in the molecular weights \(\left(M_{w}, M_{p}\right.\), and \(M_{s}\) ) of PS and PE polymers were observed by comparing the residual polymers with the respective original plastic foams. For the PS polymer, the \(M_{w}, M_{p}\), and \(M_{s}\) were significantly reduced \((p<0.01)\) by 30.6 ± 2.5\%, 45.3 ± 1.7\%, and 32.7 ± 3.8\%, respectively, with the PDI value increasing from 3.18 ± 0.08 to 4.04 ± 0.18 (Figure 2a and Table S4), indicating a typical broad depolymerization pattern (BD) of PS, similar to previous reports. \({ }^{15,41,71}\) The PDI designates the heterogeneity in the chain-length distributions of tested polymers. Therefore, these data indicated that the polymer chains of PS were greatly reduced, and the broadness of the chain distribution increased after passage through the intestines, which was also similar to the biodegradation of commercial PS products by \(Z\). atratus larvae (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). \({ }^{47,71}\)

The depolymerization of LDPE was different. The \(M_{w}, M_{p}\), and \(M_{s}\) values of the residual PE polymers increased by 16.6 ± 4.1\%, 19.9 ± 9.4\%, and 34.4 ± 6.9\%, respectively, suggesting a limited-extent depolymerization pattern (LD) (Figure 2a), as observed previously during PE degradation in \(T\). molitor and \(Z\).

The established digestive biofragmentation model was further applied to estimate the time required for the removal of different-sized PS and PE particles with initial fixed sizes ($\mu$m) of 350, 300, 250, 200, 100, and 50 by 85%, 95%, and 99%. The predicted results indicated that all PS and PE MPs with initial sizes smaller than 250 $\mu$m could be completely digested and removed (>99% removal) within 12 h of retention time (Figure 4e and 4f), if they were ingested by mealworms. The smaller the particle size, the shorter the retention time required to achieve complete digestive removal. For instance, the complete removal of MPs with an initial diameter of 50 $\mu$m would take less than 1 h. Using the predicted results, the half-life time ($t_{1/2}$) of plastic plastics (or the time required for number reduction to half of the initial value) with different sizes was estimated, which further confirmed that the smaller the size, the shorter the $t_{1/2}$ (Figure S4). The simulations explain why the NPs were well below the detection limit in the frass of the mealworms fed with PS or LDPE foam. For example, the $t_{1/2}$ values of 50 $\mu$m PS and PE particles were only about 47 and 14 min, respectively (Table S8). After 12 h of retention time, the remaining percentage (R) values of PS and PE particles with 50 $\mu$m would be only 0.0024% and 3.3 $\times$ 10$^{-14}$%, respectively. The nanosized particles would have much shorter $t_{1/2}$ values and would be rapidly removed within much shorter retention time. A recent study on PS biodegradation by PS-degrading Galleria mellonella larvae by Wang et al. (2022) indicated that after 48 h of force-feeding the larvae with PS MPs (diameter 25 $\mu$m) labeled with red-fluorescence, the fluorescent intensities declined significantly by 27%, 56%, 66%, and 80% at 3, 6, 12, and 18 h, respectively, and no fluorescent intensity was detected at 24 h. After the injection of PS microbeads with a size of 200 mesh (or 74 $\mu$m) into the Galleria mellonella larvae, the size of the PS microbeads decreased significantly at 6 h and completely disappeared at 24 h using SEM observation. The results supported that small PS MPs (74 $\mu$m or less) can be completely removed or digested in plastic-degrading insect larvae, as predicted by our digestive biofragmentation model.

The ultrafast biodegradation of PS and PE, especially for small particles, is likely the result of synergistic bioreactions between the host and gut microbes. The intestinal tissues of T. molitor larvae secreted emulsifying components of 30–100 kDa, which mediated PS bioavailability, and the intestinal microbial community also produced substances of <30 kDa that increased microbiological respiration and thus collabo- rated to achieve highly efficient plastic biodegradation. Given the plastic-digesting ability and gut microbiological conversion capacity of the mealworms, small plastic particles (e.g., in nano- or submicrometer-sized) with high specific surface (i.e., the ratio of surface area to volume or surface area to polymer mass) and surface reaction energy would be eliminated at an ultrafast speed through enzymatic and microbial reactions without significant accumulation.

The findings in this study suggest that the frass or excrement from mealworm-mediated biodegradation of plastic products (such as PS and PE foam) is relatively environmentally and biologically free of concern about NP accumulation since small-sized plastic particles are unable to significantly accumulate in the excrement. Similar hypotheses could be drawn for other macroinvertebrates with remarkable plastic-degrading capacities, such as Tenebrio obscurus larvae, Zophobas atratus larvae, Plesiophthalmus davidis, Uloma sp., Achroia grisella, and Galleria mellonella larvae, as

Environmental Implications. Based on the results of this study, we conclude that macroinvertebrates without or with poor plastic-degrading ability, e.g., Antarctic krill, freshwater amphipod, and earthworms, biofragment the ingested MPs into NPs. Rapid plastic-degrading macroinvertebrates, e.g., mealworms (T. molitor larvae), also biofragment the ingested plastic foam products into smaller-sized MPs, but accumulation of nanosized plastic particles in the frass (excrement) was not observed and not detected using highly sensitive detection methods, i.e., laser light scattering sizer and Py-GCMC analysis. The results are explained by digestive biofragmentation modeling.

In this study, we also confirmed for the first time the biodegradation of commercial PS and LDPE foam in mealworms by determining the \(\delta^{13} \mathrm{C}\) signature of the residual PS or PE in frass versus the original PS or LDPE foams. This was based on the fact that organisms preferentially take up the light isotope \({ }^{12} \mathrm{C}\), resulting in an increased \(\delta^{13} \mathrm{C}\) signature in the residual plastics due to bioreaction. This method will provide another useful and effectively scientific tool to assess the biodegradation of commercial plastics in macroinvertebrates as well as by microorganisms.

This work utilized the highly sensitive laser light scattering sizer combined with Py-GCMS analysis to accurately determine the size distribution of residual plastic particles after biodegradation of commercial PS and LDPE foams on a volume basis and to estimate the particle distribution on a number basis. The results demonstrated that the ingested plastic foams were biofragmented into MP larger than \(2 \mu \mathrm{m}\), but NPs were not detected above the detection limit in the frass. These results dispel our major concerns about the significant accumulation of NPs in frass during the insect-mediated biodegradation of commercial plastic products because NPs, as emerging tiny particulate contaminants, pose greater environmental and biological risks in natural ecosystems than MP. Future studies will be performed to further verify the absence of NPs by looking for extremely sensitive tools to assess the residual polymer content lower than the detection limits of the current tools used.

The simulated size-frequency distribution of plastic particles using the digestive biofragmentation model developed in this study highly fit the data measured by the laser particle analyzers. Further simulation using this model reveals that the ingested PS and PE polymers underwent progressive size-reduction processes under biodegradation as they passed through the intestinal tract. The digestive biofragmentation model also indicates that the size distribution of residual particles and plastic removal are functions of the retention time and initial size of the plastic particles. The simulation results are consistent with the analytical results; i.e., the ingested polymers were removed by more than \(70 \%\) after digestion in the mealworm gut, and small-sized particles were removed or biodegraded at an ultrafast speed. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that nanosized plastic particles are unlikely to accumulate in the frass of macroinvertebrates that have high plastic-degrading capacities. Other insect larvae with similar plastic-degrading features to mealworms, e.g., Zophobas atratus, Tenebrio obscurus, G. mellonella larvae, Plesiophthalus davidi, and Uloma sp., as well as land snails, need to be further tested using different commercial plastic products and high purity plastics.
