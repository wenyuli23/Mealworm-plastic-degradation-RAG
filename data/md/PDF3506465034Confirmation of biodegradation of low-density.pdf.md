## Abstract
*Tenebrio obscurus* (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) larvae are capable of biodegrading polystyrene (PS) but their capacity for polyethylene (PE) degradation and pattern of depolymerization remains unknown. This study fed the larvae of *T. obscurus* and *Tenebrio molitor*, which have PE degrading capacity, two commercial low-density PE (LDPE) foams i.e., PE-1 and PE-2, with respective number-average molecular weights \(\left(M_{n}\right)\) of 28.9 and 27.3 kDa and weight-average molecular weights \(\left(M_{w}\right)\) of 342.0 and 264.1 kDa, over a 36-day period at ambient temperature. The \(M_{w}\) of residual PE in frass (excrement) of *T. obscurus*, fed with PE-1 and PE-2, decreased by 45.4 \(\pm 0.4 \%\) and 34.8 \(\pm 0.3 \%\), respectively, while the respective decrease in frass of *T. molitor* was 43.3 \(\pm 0.5 \%\) and 31.7 \(\pm 0.5 \%\). Data analysis showed that low molecular weight PE (<5.0 kDa) was rapidly digested while longer chain portions (>10.0 kDa) were broken down or cleaved, indicating a broad depolymerization pattern. Mass balance analysis indicated nearly 40\% of ingested LDPE was digested to \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\). Antibiotic suppression of gut microbes in *T. molitor* and *T. obscurus* larvae with gentamicin obviously reduced their gut microbes on day 15 but did not stop depolymerization because the \(M_{n}, M_{w}\) and size- average molecular weight \(\left(M_{s}\right)\) decreased. This confirmed that LDPE biodegradation in *T. obscurus* was independent of gut microbes as observed during previous PS degradation in *T. molitor*, suggesting that the intestinal digestive system could perform LDPE depolymerization.


1. Introduction

Petroleum-based plastics have been widely used since the 1950s, with a global production of 359 million tons in 2018 (PlasticEurope, 2019). Major plastic polymers produced include polyethylene (PE), 29.7%; polypropylene (PP), 19.3%; polyvinyl chloride (PVC), 10.3%; polyurethane (PUR), 7.9%; polyethylene terephthalate (PET), 7.7%; and polystyrene (PS), 6.4% (PlasticEurope, 2019). The most widely used polymer, PE, which is expressed as "[CH2 - CH2]n", is comprised of a linear carbon backbone. Commercial products made from this polymer include low-density PE (LDPE), linear low-density PE (LLDPE), medium density PE (MDPE), and high-density PE (HDPE). LDPE and LLDPE constitute about 17.5% of global plastic production, while MDPE and HDPE account for 12.2% (PlasticsEurope, 2019). Due to their highly stable C-C and C-H covalent bonds, high molecular weights, hydrophobic properties, and the absence of readily oxidizable and/or hydrolysable groups, PE is extremely resistant to biodegradation (Gautam et al., 2007). As a result, microplastics and nanoplastics which are largely comprised of PE are considered emerging environmental contaminants (Wu et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2021).

Research on PE biodegradation with microbial cultures has been reported since the early 1970s (Sen and Raut, 2015). Research results showed that PE-biodegradability by microorganisms or enzymes is limited even after pretreatment processes such as photo- or thermo-oxidation of polymers were applied (Hadad et al., 2005; Sudhakar et al., 2008; Watanabe et al., 2009; Nowak et al., 2011; Wilkes and Aristilde, 2017). However, recent studies revealed that PE can be rapidly biodegraded or digested in the larvae guts of members of the darkling beetle family (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) i.e., Tenebrio molitor (yellow mealworms) (Brandon et al., 2018; Yang and Wu, 2020; Yang et al., 2021a) and Zophobas atratus (superworms) (Peng et al., 2020a) in a matter of hours; and can be ingested and biodegraded by the larvae of some pest moths (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) i.e., Indian mealmoths (Plodia interpunctella) (Yang et al., 2014), greater waxworms (Galleria mellonella) (Bombelli et al., 2017; Kong et al., 2019; Lou et al., 2020), and lesser waxworms (Achroia grissella) (Kundugal et al., 2019).

Darkling beetle is the common name of the family Tenebrionidae, the seventh-most speciose taxon in Order Coleoptera which comprises of approximately 20,000 species across 2300 genera worldwide (Slipinski et al., 2011). To date, six species (T. molitor, T. obscurus, Z. atratus, Tribolium castaneum, Plesiophthalmus davids, and Uloma sp.) of darkling beetle have been confirmed to biodegrade PS plastics (Yang et al., 2015a; Peng et al., 2019; Peng et al., 2020a; Wang et al., 2021; Woo et al., 2020; Wu and Cridde, 2021; Kundugal et al., 2021), with T.molitor and Z.atratus additionally capable of degrading LDPE (Brandon et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2021b; Peng et al., 2020a). The larvae of commercial species T. molitor, T. obscurus and Z. atratus are attractive for their natural presence in forests with rotting wood (Calmont and Soldati, 2008) and known to consume dried leaves rich in lignocellulosic materials (Peng et al., 2019, 2020a). T. molitor and Z. atratus larvae sourced from China and the USA showed ubiquity in biodegradation of PS and LDPE (Yang et al., 2015a, b; Yang et al., 2018a, b; Yang et al., 2021a; Peng et al., 2020a; Yang and Wu, 2020). T. molitor larvae can also biodegrade polyvinyl chloride (PVC) (Peng et al., 2020b), polypropylene (Yang et al., 2021b), and hydrolyzable bioplastic polyactic acid (PLA) (Peng et al., 2021). In addition, T. molitor larvae were not negatively impacted by the additive hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), a flame retardant in PS foam and other plastics, and did not accumulate HBCD in the biomass (Brandon et al., 2020).

Based on updated evidence, we hypothesized that members of darkling beetle which chew and ingest lignocellulosic materials, especially the Tenebrio genus, are capable of degrading major non-hydrolyzable and hydrolyzable plastics such as PS, LDPE, PP, PVC and PET. Tenebrio genus includes at least three morphologically different species, distinguished primarily by the color of their larvae i.e., yellow- (T. molitor Linnaeus 1758), dark- (T. obscurus Fabricius 1792), and brown- (T. opacus Duftschmid 1812) mealworms (Calmont and Soldati, 2008). T. molitor and T. obscurus have been reported worldwide (Peng et al., 2019) and commercially sold as a food source for pets, chicken and small animals in China, the USA, Europe and many other countries. In Europe, T. molitor is also authorized to be used for cattle, farmed fish and human consumption (EU Regulation 2017/89). Although the diet and life behavior of the yellow-colored T. molitor and larvae of T. obscurus differ (Peng et al., 2019), both have been observed to eat dried tree leaves. Previous research demonstrated that the larvae of T. obscurus are capable of biodegrading PS foam via gut microbe dependent depolymerization based on antibiotic suppression test, i.e. PS depolymerization stopped as the level of gut microbes dropped to nearly zero in the presence of the antibiotic gentamicin (Peng et al., 2019). The PS-degrading capacity of T. obscurus is similar to that of T. molitor larvae with gut-microbe dependence (Yang et al., 2015b; Yang et al., 2018b). However, it remains unknown whether T. obscurus has a similar LDPE-degrading capacity to T. molitor, and if this ability is ubiquitous in the Tenebrio genus.

Biodegradation of non-hydrolyzable plastics such as PE involves breaking down polymer chains (depolymerization) followed by the degradation and mineralization of intermediates to CO2 and H2O (Yang et al., 2014). This first and essential reaction of depolymerization is commonly characterized using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) based on changes in the number-average molecular weight (Mn), weight-average molecular weight (Mw), size-average weight (Mz) and molecular weight distribution (MWD) of polymers. The formation of oxidized functional groups is usually verified using analysis by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and other analytical methods (Yang et al., 2018b; Peng et al., 2020a, b; Wu and Cridde, 2021). The role of gut microbes in plastic degradation is commonly characterized by monitoring depolymerization while inhibiting their function using antibiotics. If depolymerization is inhibited with the suppression of gut microbes, the biodegradation is regarded as gut-microbe dependent, otherwise, it is considered to be independent of gut microbes (Yang et al., 2015b; Yang et al., 2018a; Peng et al

After start-up tests, the mass of residual LDPE foam was weighed to calculate PE consumption every 6 days. Survival rates (SRs) of the larvae were calculated based on the number of live larvae versus the number of initially inoculated larvae. The LDPE consumption and SRs were monitored until day 36. During this 36-day period, no pupae were observed, similar to observations with LDPE as the sole diet for \( T\). molitor (Brandon et al., 2018). Dead larvae were counted and removed from the containers to prevent the larvae from eating dead bodies, although cannibalism still occurred during the incubation period as observed previously (Peng et al., 2019). At the end of the test, the larvae were cleansed with compressed air to remove residual LDPE debris, then transferred to a clean PP container for 12 h to collect frass. The frass samples were stored at \(-20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) for further analysis. For DNA analysis of the gut microbes, larval samples (at least 20) were collected at the end of 36-day test, preserved in 100% ethanol (analytical grade) and stored at \(-80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\).

Biodegradation of LDPE in the larvae was characterized by determining any physical and chemical modifications, changes in chemical structure, and biodegraded intermediates and products (Wu and Criddle, 2021). Depolymerization of LDPE was characterized by collecting frass samples and analyzing residual PE polymers to determine \( \mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{n}}\), \( \mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{w}} \), and \( \mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{s}} \) as well as MWG with high-temperature gel permeation chromatography (HT-GPC, PL GPC 220, Agilent Technologies, Inc., USA). Frass samples (100 mg) for each treatment group were collected, dried, and gently crushed in a mortar and pestle. Extraction of residual PE from the samples was conducted by dissolving PE in 4 mL of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (1,2,4 TCB) solvent (Honeywell International, Inc., USA) followed by a 4-h heating period to facilitate extraction. The extracted solvent was filtered through an original stainless-steel filter and transferred into a clean glass vial. The extracted polymer was dried, weighed, and redissolved in 1,2,4-TCB solvent to obtain a final concentration of 1.2 mg/mL prior to injection into HT-GPC. The analysis of each sample was performed at 150°C using a 200 \(\mu \mathrm{L}\) injection volume with an eluent (1,2,4 TCB) flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. PDI was calculated as PDI \(=\frac{\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{w}}}{\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{n}}}\).

Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis (Nicolet iS50 FTIR Spectrometer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, U.S.A.) was used to characterize the major functional groups in the frass of LDPE-fed larvae versus respective LDPE feedstocks. Frass samples were ground with potassium bromide (KBr) into homogeneous powders for scanning and graphing with FTIR. The spectra of all samples were obtained in absorbance mode and in the spectral region of 400-4000 cm \({ }^{-1}\) using a resolution of 0.6329 cm \({ }^{-1}\) and a minimum of 16 scans.

\({ }^{1} \mathrm{H}\) NMR analysis was performed to characterize the formation of oxidized functional groups in the residual polymers extracted from frass samples. The control LDPE samples were PE-1 and PE-2 foams. Frass samples (10 mg) of LDPE-fed larvae were gently crushed in a mortar

and dissolved in 1 mL chloroform-D solvent (D, 99.8%, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., Andover, U.S.A.) in a 10 mL glass bottle. The glass bottle was heated for 4 h at 55 °C in a thermostat water bath. After heating extraction, the extracted residual polymer was resuspended in chloroform-D and analyzed by using a Bruker Avance NEO 600 spectrometer (Bruker Corporation, Germany). The 1H-spectra [16 scans, delay time (d1) = 1.0 s] were referenced to the residual deuterated-chloroform peak [7.26 ppm]. Spectra were analyzed using MestReNova software (v12.0.1). 1H NMR analyses were run in triplicates for samples of both LDPE foams and residual polymer samples.

Biodegradation of LDPE is indicated by a decrease in stability. LDPE foams (PE-1 and PE-2) and frass samples containing residual LDPE were analyzed by TGA (TGA/SDTA851e, Mettler Toledo, U.S.A.). Samples were heated from 30 to 900 °C at a rate of 10 K/min under a high-purity nitrogen ambiance (99.999%).

### 2.5. Carbon mass balance analysis

Test of the carbon mass balance for the ingested LDPE by \( T. molitor \) and \( T. obscurus \) larvae was conducted using batch trails with incubators equipped with a four- stage CO2 trapping system modified from that described by Yang et al. (2015a). The larvae (200 per incubator) were incubated in glass jars (1000 mL in volume) and fed a sole diet of their respective PE-1 and PE-2 foams (0.5 g) with triplicates (Fig. S3). An additional two jars without the larvae served as the control. Released CO2 was trapped in a 2 M NaOH solution and carbon in CO2 was recovered as CaCO3 precipitate by adding CaCl2. LDPE in frass was extracted using an olive oil-based method developed by Scopetani et al. (2020). The carbon balance analysis was conducted to measure the carbon mass of ingested LDPE, PE residue in frass, CO2 released from biodegradation, and increment of carbon in biomass in addition to estimating the digestibility of the ingested LDPE, carbon conversion rate of digested LDPE to CO2, and the ratio of the carbon assimilated to biomass after biodegradation. The measurement was conducted after 18 days incubation. The detailed procedures and calculation are described in Supporting information.

### 2.6. Antibiotic suppression test

The effect of antibiotic suppression on PE depolymerization and biodegradation was tested using the larvae of \( T. molitor \) and \( T. obscurus \) larvae with gentamicin sulfate (Yang et al., 2015b; Yang et al., 2018a; Peng et al., 2019; Peng et al., 2020b). The selection of antibiotics was re-examined prior to antibiotic suppression tests in this study. Six different antibiotics (gentamicin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, kanamycin sulfate, penicillin, and tetracycline) were screened for their ability to inhibit gut bacteria from \( T. molitor \) larvae based on inhibition halo tests (Figs. S2, SI Section S2 in Supporting information) described by Visotto et al. (2009) and Yang et al. (2015b). The gut suspension (100 μL) was inoculated and spread across an Luria-Bertani (LB) medium plate (Wu and Cridde, 2021). Subsequently, the antibiotic discs of the six aforementioned antibiotics (30 μg antibiotics per disc) were placed on the surface of the inoculated plates. The discs containing no antibiotic served as the control. The plates were incubated in triplicates for 24 h at 37 °C, and then the inhibition halos were measured. The antibiotic resulting in the biggest inhibition halo was selected for suppressing the gut bacteria.

LB medium was prepared with DI water containing (per 1000 mL) 10 g bacteriological tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, 10 g NaCl and 15 g agar. All media were sterilized by autoclaving at 121 °C for 30 min.

Two gentamicin suppressive groups (500 larvae) were fed antibiotic feedstocks containing bran plus gentamicin sulfate 100:3 (w/w) for 15 days and then fed with PE-1 and PE-2 feedstocks, respectively. On day 0, 7, and 15, larvae gut samples (20 each) were randomly selected from each diet group to prepare a gut suspension for counting of the gut microbes. The larval specimen was decontaminated with 75% ethanol, rinsed by Milli-Q water, and anatomized to obtain guts for further microbial community analyses.

Gut contents were extracted and suspended in 5 mL sterile saline water, serial diluted (10−1 to 10−7) and inoculated on nonselective TSA plates at 37 °C for 24 h. The procedure was the same as described previously (Yang et al., 2018a). After day 15, antibiotic feedstock was continuously fed together with LDPE diet and resupplied every 2 days during LDPE feeding period. Frass samples from the antibiotic treatment were collected to analyze the molecular weights using HT-GPC analysis.

### 2.7. Microbial community analysis

To compare the changes in gut communities of \( T. molitor \) and \( T. obscurus \) larvae before and after feeding LDPE, 20 larvae from each \( T. molitor \) and \( T. obscurus \) group fed with the two LDPE foams (PE-1and PE-2) were randomly selected for microbial community analyses at the beginning and the end of the 36-day experiment. All treatments in the tests were performed in triplicates. Samples used for DNA extraction included the larvae fed each LDPE, bran, and the unfed larvae which were euthanized and preserved in 80% alcohol. Subsequently, the larval body was washed with sterile deionized water three times. After dissection, the intestinal tissues with ingested/digested contents were collected and stored in 100% ethanol (analytical grade) at −80 °C prior to use. All DNA from the larval gut plus a small amount of frass that remained in the gut was extracted for microbial community analysis. Total bacterial genomic DNA samples were extracted using Fast DNA SPIN extraction kits (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA extraction and PCR amplification methods were similar to that reported previously (Lou et al., 2020). Phasing amplicon sequencing was applied to sequence the V3 — V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Purified amplicons were paired-end 2 × 300 bp sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform with MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 at Shanghai Personal Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The low-quality sequences were filtered through following criteria (Gill et al., 2006; Chen and Jiang, 2014) i.e., length < 150 bp, average Phred scores <20, containing ambiguous bases, and containing mononucleotide repeats >8 bp. Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) were clustered with 0.97 identity threshold using UPARSE (v9.2.64). Chimeric sequences were identified and removed using UCHIME (v4.2.40). Taxonomy of each 16S rRNA gene sequence was analyzed by Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Classifier against the Silva 16S rRNA database with a confidence threshold of 70%. Sequence data analyses were mainly performed using QIIME (v1.9.1) and R packages (v3.4.3) including OTU-level alpha diversity analysis, microbial community composition analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis.

### 2.8. Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were conducted to evaluate the differences in PE consumption, survival, changes in molecular weights, antibiotic suppression on PE depolymerization, and microbial diversity. ANOVAs were performed, followed by pairwise comparisons using Student's t-test with Tukey's correction to assess significance. Statistical analyses were performed in IBM SPSS Statistics (v25). All p-values are adjusted p values and all error values are average ± standard deviation.

### 3. Results and discussion

#### 3.1. LDPE foam consumption by \( T. obscurus \) vs \( T. molitor \) larvae

The larvae of both \( T. molitor \) and \( T. obscurus \) were able to chew and eat LD

The SRs of the bran-fed \( T. molitor \) larvae was \( 96.1 \pm 0.5\% \) and that of the \( T. obscurus \) larvae was \( 90.4 \pm 0.7\% \). The results indicated that the SR of the larvae fed with LDPE foams were statistically similar to those fed with bran during the 36 days. However, \( T. molitor \) larvae had slightly higher SR than \( T. obscurus \) larvae regardless of whether they were fed bran or LDPE foams (Fig. 1b and Table 1). For unfed groups, SR was only \( 71.7 \pm 0.6\% \) and \( 74.3 \pm 1.9\% \) for \( T. molitor \) and \( T. obscurus \) larvae, respectively, significantly \( (p < 0.01) \) lower than those of the two PE-fed \( T. molitor \) larvae (PE-1: \( 95.6 \pm 0.4\% \); PE-2: \( 95.5 \pm 2.2\% \)) and \( T. obscurus \) larvae (PE-1: \( 88.6 \pm 0.5\% \); PE-2: \( 91.6 \pm 0.7\% \)), indicating that the larvae ingested LDPE foams and maintained activities for their survival. This was also observed previously when the larvae of both


Specific LDPE consumption rates (SPCR, mg PE 100 larvae \(\mathrm{d}^{-1}\) ) were calculated based on the LDPE mass consumed by 100 larvae over the test period using the average number of live larvae (Wu and Cridde, 2021). Over 36-day, SPCRs of PE-1 and PE-2 for \(T\). molitor larvae were \(5.0 \pm 0.7\) and \(4.9 \pm 0.3 \mathrm{mg} \cdot 100\) worms \(\mathrm{d}^{-1}\), respectively; and SPCRs of PE-1 and PE-2 for \(T\). obscurus larvae were \(4.5 \pm 0.4\) and \(3.4 \pm 0.3 \mathrm{mg} \cdot 100\) larvae \(\mathrm{d}^{-1}\), respectively (Fig. 1c and Table 1). Although both species showed similar LDPE consumption rates, the \(T\). molitor larvae had slightly higher LDPE SPCRs than \(T\). obscurus because \(T\). obscurus larvae used in this study had larger average size and weight than that of the \(T\). molitor larvae (Graphic abstract). Based on the average weight of the larvae, the specific LDPE consumption rate on larval weight basis (SPCR-W, mg PE g larvae \(\mathrm{d}^{-1}\) ) of \(T\). obscurus larvae was much lower than that of \(T\). molitor. The SPCR-W of PE-1 was \(2.6 \pm 0.4 \mathrm{mg}\) LDPE \(\cdot \mathrm{g}\) larvae \(\mathrm{d}^{-1}\) and PE-2 was \(2.4 \pm 0.1 \mathrm{mg}\) LDPE \(\cdot \mathrm{g}\) larvae \(\mathrm{d}^{-1}\) for \(T\). molitor larvae while the respective rates for \(T\). obscurus larvae were \(0.4 \pm 0.0 \mathrm{mg}\) LDPE \(\cdot \mathrm{g}\) larvae \(\mathrm{d}^{-1}\) and \(0.3 \pm 0.0 \mathrm{mg}\) LDPE \(\cdot \mathrm{g}\) larvae \(\mathrm{d}^{-1}\) (Fig. 1d and Table 1). Chewing by the larvae enhanced fragmentation of LDPE film, resulting in an increased contact area for LDPE with the gut microbial consortia and enzymes. The insect's alimentary tract is split into three main parts: the foregut (stomodeum), midgut (mesenteron), and hindgut (proctodeum) (Chapman, 2013). The larval gut can be considered an efficient bioreactor. Gut microbial consortia and gut enzymes are likely critical for the rapid LDPE biodegradation in the bioreactor. Further study is needed to understand whether the difference in the consumption rates between the larvae of the two species tested in this study is generic or larval source specific (i.e., insect mouth feeders, stretch receptors, body wall, and alimentary canal), since the eating habits of the two species are different (Makkar et al., 2014).

\subsection*{3.2. LDPE depolymerization}

LDPE depolymerization and biodegradation through the digestive intestine of \(T\). molitor and \(T\). obscurus larvae was characterized using HT-GPC analysis (Fig. 2). Both PE-1 and PE-2 were significantly depolymerized by the larvae of \(T\). obscurus and \(T\). molitor based on the molecular weight changes and MWD. It was observed that the MWD shifted towards lower molecular weights after the LDPE polymers were partially digested and egested in frass (Fig. 2a and b). For PE-1 fed larvae of \(T\). molitor and \(T\). obscurus, \(M_{\mathrm{n}}\) was reduced by \(7.6 \pm 0.9\) and \(10.4 \pm 0.3\) respectively; \(M_{\mathrm{w}}\) was reduced by \(43.3 \pm 0.5\) and \(45.4 \pm 0.4\), respectively, and \(M_{\mathrm{z}}\) was reduced by \(45.0 \%\) and \(50.1 \%\), respectively. For PE-2 fed larvae of \(T\). molitor and \(T\). obscurus, \(M_{\mathrm{n}}\) was reduced by \(11.0 \pm 0.2 \%\) and \(6.6 \pm 0.7 \%\); \(M_{\mathrm{w}}\) dropped by \(31.7 \pm 0.5\) and \(34.8 \pm 0.3 \%\), and \(M_{\mathrm{z}}\) declined by \(37.2 \pm 0.5\) and \(46.0 \pm 0.4 \%\), respectively (Fig. 2c and d). Results showed significant reductions \((p<0.05)\) in \(M_{\mathrm{n}}, M_{\mathrm{w}}\), and \(M_{\mathrm{z}}\) of PE-1 and PE-2 after passage through the digestive tract of the larvae of both species, confirming that both performed broad depolymerization (Table 2). From the results obtained in this study, the extent of the decrease in \(M_{\mathrm{n}}, M_{\mathrm{w}}\), and \(M_{\mathrm{z}}\) of the two LDPE foams by \(T\). obscurus larvae were higher than that of \(T\). molitor larvae, similar to observations of PS degradation by \(T\). obscurus versus \(T\). molitor (Peng et al., 2019). This suggested that the \(T\). obscurus larvae tested might have higher plastic polymer digestibility than \(T\). molitor larvae.

The fractional distribution of molecular weight of the two LDPE foams and the corresponding LDPE residues extracted from the frass of \(T\). molitor and \(T\). obscurus larvae were analyzed for comparison in Fig. 2e and f. Frass samples from the \(T\). molitor and \(T\). obscurus fed with PE-1 only contained \(<0.2 \%\) and \(4.99 \%\) of small sized polymer \(<2.0 \mathrm{kDa}\) while raw PE-1 foam contained \(8.52 \%\) of the small sized polymer (Fig. 2e). Similarly, the residual polymers in the frass from \(T\). molitor and \(T\). obscurus fed with PE-2 contained \(1.85 \%\) and \(0.29 \%\) of the small polymer, respectively (Fig. 2f, Table S3), which was significantly lower than \(8.50 \%\) of the small polymer in PE-2 foam. Higher molecular fractions \(>1000 \mathrm{kDa}\) detected in the frass samples from \(T\). molitor and \(T\). obscurus larvae were also reduced (Fig. 2e and f). However, the fraction of polymer with molecular weight between 10.0 and \(100 \mathrm{kDa}\) were higher in the frass samples from both \(T\). molitor and \(T\). obscurus larvae, suggesting their accumulation during biodegradation. Previous research on pretreatments using thermo-oxidative PE degradation with pro-oxidant revealed that reduction of the average molecular weight to below \(5.0 \mathrm{kDa}\) was the most important step to achieve significant bio- degradation (Jakubowicz, 2003; Koutny et al., 2006) because low molecular weight fractions \((<5.0 \mathrm{kDa})\) can be rapidly decomposed (Chiellini et al., 2003; Kawai et al., 2004), and possibly metabolized (Reddy et al., 2009). When the molecular weight distribution at about \(5.0 \mathrm{kDa}\) or less contributes to a substantial part, e.g., \(20 \%\) of the polymers under 1.0 or 2.0 kDa, this fraction can be, by comparison, rapidly biodegraded due to the microbial contribution (Chiellini et al., 2003; Kawai et al., 2004). In this study, based on the changes in molecular weight fraction distribution (Fig. 2e and f, Table S3), depolymerization and biodegradation of polymers resulted in a decrease of polymer fractions with molecular weight greater than \(1000 \mathrm{kDa}\) with PE-1, thus indicating positive capacity of degrading large polymers in the larvae. The decrease of

Both \(T\). molitor and \(T\). obscurus performed similarly for carbon conversion (Fig. 1f). The results indicated that \(T\). obscurus larvae did digest LDPE to \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) and assimilated a small fraction as biomass, which is consistent with the observation of LDPE conversion by \(T\). molitor as reported by Brandon et al. (2018).

T. molitor were similar and revealed the bond changes and the formation of new functional groups through the incorporation of oxygen (Fig. 3a and b). FTIR analysis confirmed the identity of the LDPE film materials with peaks at 2921 cm⁻¹ and 2852 cm⁻¹ as C—H stretch bonds, the classical signatures of PE (Bombelli et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2020a; Yang et al., 2021a), but the intensities were much weaker in all frass samples. The characteristic peak for LDPE samples around 1500 cm⁻¹ which represented the C — H ring, had high intensity in the PE-1 and PE-2 feedstock but disappeared in all frass samples. Appearance of a peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretch) in the treated sample, is a classical signature of the carbonyl bond. Furthermore, the formation of an absorbance peak around 3300 cm⁻¹ in the FTIR spectra of all frass samples is associated with the hydrogen bond of hydroxyl groups and/or carboxylic acid groups, suggesting that the surface had a change from hydrophobic to more hydrophilic property (Yang et al., 2018a; Peng et al., 2019). The appearance and disappearance of the peaks were similar to previous observations during LDPE biodegradation by T. molitor, Z. atratus and G. mellonella larvae (Bombelli et al., 2017; Brandon et al., 2018; Peng et al., 2020a; Yang et al., 2021a). The FTIR results indicated that T. obscurus larvae performed oxidation and biodegradation of LDPE in a same pattern as observed with T. molitor larvae.

Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H NMR) spectra of the extracted polymers from the frass egested by T. molitor and T. obscurus larvae were compared with the spectra of raw LDPE foams (Fig. 3c and d). New peaks were observed in frass samples in the range of 1.0–2.0 ppm denoting a ¹H chemical shift and formation of CH₃ moiety, which is induced by the breakdown of long chain polymers after biodegradation (Skariyachan et al., 2018). Sharp new peaks in frass samples were observed in regions between 2.9 and 3.9 ppm, which are attributed to the CH₂ groups next to a nitrogen atom and the carbonyl group of the linker (Peng et al., 2020a). Also, new peaks at 2.78 ppm observed in frass samples corresponded to different metabolites or residues of proteins, like amino acids (Zainal et al., 2019). Furthermore, obvious increases in the intensities of regions at around 2.3 ppm in frass samples from LDPE-fed larvae also proved the existence of chemical modifications resulting in LDPE biodegradation as observed during HDPE biodegradation by lesser waxworms (A. grisella) and larvae of genus Uloma (Kundungal et al., 2019, 2021). The spectra of the frass sample indicated the presence of new peaks between 3.5 and 4.0 ppm (aldehyde moiety) which were absent in the original LDPE foams. Based on the shift in the peaks, the organic species possible were considered as: aliphatic protons from 0.77 ppm to 3.6 ppm region (H — C, CH₃, and CH₂); a shift to α position carbon atoms to Cx-C=O or C=O group (carbonyl/aminic), and Cx — C — H groups (unsaturated allylic) (Kundungal et al., 2019), indicating the incorporation of oxygen, which was consistent with FTIR analyses (Fig. 3a and b). New peaks around δH = 5.36 ppm in a region associated with alkene bonds (C=CH) (Fig. 3c and d) were found in the FTIR spectra of the residual

The role of larval gut microbes in the biodegradation of LDPE was examined using the antibiotic gentamicin test. Previous inhibition halo tests with ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, and vancomycin showed gentamicin had best ability to inhibit gut microbes of \( T. molitor \) larvae (Yang et al., 2015b). Prior to the test, we conducted an inhibition halo test with a group of six antibiotics (gentamicin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, kanamycin sulfate, penicillin, and tetracycline), which were different from those tested by Yang et al. (2015b), to examine the ability to inhibit gut bacteria from \( T. molitor \) larvae. The results demonstrated that the sequence of inhibition halos (mm) was: gentamicin (32.08 ± 1.60) > penicillin (27.92 ± 1.98) > kanamycin sulfate (26.25 ± 2.85) > chloramphenicol (25.00 ± 1.36) > tetracycline (21.67 ± 1.636) (Fig. S2). Gentamicin showed the best ability to inhibit the gut bacteria, with clearer and broader halos (Fig. S2).

Gentamicin sulfate and test procedures were similar to previous studies on the biodegradation of PS and PVC using \( T. molitor \), \( T. obscurus \) and \( Z. atratus \) larvae (Yang et al., 2015b; Yang et al., 2018a; Peng et al., 2019; Peng et al., 2020a, b; Yang et al., 2021b; Wu and Criddle, 2021). After the larvae of \( T. molitor \) and \( T. obscurus \) were fed with the mixture of bran plus gentamicin, larval samples (20 per test group) were taken on day 7, 15, and 20 to prepare gut suspensions for the counting of gut microorganisms. The larvae not fed gentamicin served as samples for day 0 (or control). Gut bacterial numbers in \( T. molitor \) and \( T. obscurus \) larvae dropped significantly from 3.13 \(\times 10^{6}\) and \(1.03 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{CFU}\) per gut on day 0 to \(1.11 \times 10^{5}\) and \(0.99 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{CFU}\) per gut on day 7, and continuously decreased to \(6.2 \times 10^{4}\) and \(4.4 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{CFU}\) per gut on day 15. After antibiotics suppression for 15 days, the numbers of CFU decreased by almost two to three magnitudes (Fig. 4a and b), implying that the gut bacteria were effectively suppressed by gentamicin sulfate. The frass of the larvae fed on PE-1 and PE-2 was collected to analyze residual polymers extracted with 1,2,4-TCB using HT-GPC (Fig. 4c and d). The results showed that the depolymerization was negatively impacted but didn't stop in both \( T. molitor \) and \( T. obscurus \) larvae even when gut bacteria were severely inhibited (Fig. 4c and d). In the presence of gentamicin, \( T. molitor \) larvae reduced \( \mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{n}} \) of residual PE-1 and PE-2 by \(4.8 \pm 0.4 \%\) and \(5.5 \pm 0.2 \%\), respectively; \( \mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{w}} \) of residual PE-1 and PE-2 by \(12.3 \pm 0.2 \%\) and \(8.1 \pm 0.3 \%\), respectively; and \( \mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{z}} \) of residual PE-1 and PE-2 by \(13.9 \pm 0.3 \%\) and \(9.2 \pm 0.4 \%\), respectively. Under similar conditions, \( T. obscurus \) larvae reduced \( \mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{n}} \) of residual PE-1 and PE-2 by \(6.9 \pm 0.3 \%\) and \(2.9 \pm 0.2 \%\), respectively, \( \mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{w}} \) of residual PE-1 and PE-2 by \(16.4 \pm 1.9 \%\) and \(10.2 \pm 0.6 \%\), respectively, and \( \mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{z}} \) of residual PE-1 and PE-2 by \(18.1 \pm 0.2 \%\) and \(13.4 \pm 0.5 \%\), respectively. For both Tenebrio species, \( \mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{n}} \) of the residual polymers after antibiotics suppression was less significantly impacted with a decrease of only around \(5 \%\), i.e., no statistical difference between LDPE foams and residual LDPE polymers extracted from the frass of gentamicin suppression groups; the \( \mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{n}} \) and \( \mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{w}} \) of residual LDPE foams extracted from the frass of gentamicin suppression groups were significantly different \((p<0.05)\) from LDPE foams, suggesting that the LDPE depolymerization or biodegradation by both \( T. molitor \) and \( T. obscurus \) larvae was gut-microbe independent. A previous study similarly observed that LDPE depolymerization was independent in \( T. molitor \) larvae (Yang et al., 2021a). On the other hand, significant differences \((p<0.05)\) were observed in \( \mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{n}}, \mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{w}} \), and \( \mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{z}} \) values between residual PE polymers extracted from the frass samples of the control and gentamicin treatments. This is evidence that gentamicin suppressed gut microbiota and also partially inhibited LDPE depolymerization by both \( T. molitor \) and \( T. obscurus \) larvae.

We also compared the changes in the fraction of small sized polymers (<2.0 kDa) in the frass of the larvae with and without antibiotic treatments. With antibiotic treatment, the frass samples from \( T. molitor \) and \( T. obscurus \) fed with PE-1 contained 3.89\% and 5.98\% of the small sized polymer (<2 kDa) and those fed with PE-2 included 4.54\% and 3.23\% of the small sized polymers, while the PE-1 form had 8.52\% and PE-2 had 8.50\% (Fig. 4e and f, Table S3), indicating the removal of small sized polymers under antibiotic suppression. However, the frass of the \( T. molitor \) and \( T. obscurus \) larvae of the control group (without antibiotic treatment) contained only <0.2\% and 4.99\% of the small sized polymers with PE-1, and 1.85\% and 0.29\% with PE-2. Similar to frass analyses without antibiotics, the fraction of polymers with molecular weight between 10.0 and 100 kDa were slightly increased or decreased in the frass samples with antibiotics (Fig. 4e and f, Table S3). However, depolymerization of larger polymers (>100 kDa) showed a reduced rate in the presence of antibiotics for PE-1 and basically unchanged for PE-2 suggesting that the synergistic efforts of gut microbes and digestive enzymes were depressed under antibiotic gentamicin conditions. The data in this study indicated that depolymerization of LDPE by both \( T. molitor \) and \( T. obscurus \) larvae was not completely dependent on gut microbes (Fig. 4a and b). This is different from the previously studies with PS that the PS depolymerization in \( T. molitor \) larvae and \( T. obscurus \) was inhibited or stopped in with antibiotic gentamicin (Yang et al., 2015a; Yang et al., 2018a; Peng et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2021a). Therefore, LDPE depolymerization in both \( T. molitor \) and \( T. obscurus \

4. Conclusions and future studies

The results of this study demonstrated the following conclusions:

a) Dark mealworms, the larvae of another member of darkling beetle, Tenebrio obscurus which belongs to the same genus of Tenebrio molitor (yellow mealworms) are also capable of biodegrading LDPE polymers.

b) The depolymerization of LDPE polymers is independent or less dependent on gut microbes, similar to T. molitor. The larvae of the two species were fed two different commercial LDPE foams with respective M<sub>0</sub> of 28.9 and 27.3 kDa, and M<sub>w</sub> of 342.0 and 264.1 kDa and digested both LDPEs.

c) Analysis of distribution of molecular weights of LDPE polymers indicated that low-molecular weight regions (especially <5.0 kDa) rapidly degraded, and large molecular weight regions (>1000 kDa) also decreased as the larvae performed broad LDPE depolymerization.

d) Carbon balance analysis indicated that majority of digested LDPE converted/oxidized to CO<sub>2</sub>.

e) Biodegradation of ingested LDPE was confirmed through the formation of oxidized intermediates and chemical/physical modifications which was confirmed using FTIR, 1H NMR and TGA analyses.

f) The low extent of broad depolymerization under antibiotic gentamicin suppression suggested the presence of digestive enzyme(s) to break down LDPE.

g) Gut community was changed significantly after the larvae received a diet of LDPE compared with those fed on bran and unfed.

h) Gut microbiome analyses revealed that the predominant gut microbes associated with LDPE degradation included bacterial families of Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcaceae and Streptococcaceae. At the genus level, Spiroplasma sp. and Enterococcus sp. were strongly associated with LDPE biodegradation.

Further studies will focus on mechanisms of plastic biodegradation in T. obscurus and other darkling beetles. Although the depolymerization of LDPE in both T. obscurus and T. molitor is independent of gut microbe, the collaboration of the insect host and its microbiome could still play a critical role in the rapid biodegradation of plastics. A recent report by Brandon et al. (2021) indicated that T. molitor larvae secretes one or more emulsifying factor(s) with 30–100 kDa that mediate plastic bioavailability and significantly enhanced PS biodegradation by gut bacterial enrichment from the larval gut. Further studies are needed to explore whether T. obscurus larvae also secrete the same or similar emulsifying factor(s) and the efficacy of the factor(s) on the biodegradation of LDPE as well as other plastics (e.g., PVC, PP, PET, etc.) which have not been tested for biodegradation by T. obscurus.
