## Abstract
Academics researchers and "citizen scientists" from 22 countries confirmed that yellow mealworms, the larvae of Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus, can survive by eating polystyrene (PS) foam. More detailed assessments of this capability for mealworms were carried out by 12 sources: five from the USA, six from China, and one from Northern Ireland. All of these mealworms digested PS foam. PS mass decreased and depolymerization was observed, with appearance of lower molecular weight residuals and functional groups indicative of oxidative transformations in extracts from the frass (insect excrement). An addition of gentamycin (30 mg g \({ }^{-1}\) ), a bactericidal antibiotic, inhibited depolymerization, implicating the gut microbiome in the biodegradation process. Microbial community analyses demonstrated significant taxonomic shifts for mealworms fed diets of PS plus bran and PS alone. The results indicate that mealworms from diverse locations eat and metabolize PS and support the hypothesis that this capacity is independent of the geographic origin of the mealworms, and is likely ubiquitous to members of this species.

## 1. Introduction

The accumulation of petroleum-based synthetic plastic wastes, including polystyrene (PS), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyurethane (PUR), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), is a major environmental concern, with up to 6300 million metric tons generated to date (Geyer et al., 2017). Plastic degradation is defined as a physical or chemical change in the polymer due to environmental factors, such as light, heat, moisture, chemical conditions or biological activity (Shah et al., 2008). During microbial biodegradation, polymers are first depolymerized to smaller monomers, which are further degraded for energy or assimilated. Ultimate biodegradation or mineralization is achieved when the degraded monomers are converted to \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\), water, and stabilized microbial biomass. Most petroleum-based plastics are resistant to biodegradation (Otake et al., 1995; Shah et al., 2008). One of the most commonly used plastics is PS, \(\left[\left(-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5}\right) \mathrm{CH}_{2}-\right]_{n}\), constituting 71\% of annual plastic production (Wu et al., 2017). PS products and materials are used in diverse applications, including eyeglasses frames, plastic cups, egg trays, packaging, and building insulation (Plastics Europe, 2016). Consequently, PS has become a major pollutant of soils, rivers, lakes, and oceans (Zhou et al., 2011) and a source of microplastics (<5 mm) (Hidalgo-Ruz et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2017). Although resistant to microbial biodegradation in a wide range of habitats (Guillet et al., 1974; Jones et al., 1974; Sielicki et al., 1978; Kaplan et al., 1979; Mor and Sivan, 2008; Råberg and Hafren, 2008), PS is now known to be susceptible to rapid biodegradation in the gut of yellow mealworms (Yang et al., 2015a, Yang et al., 2018; Brandon et al., 2018), the larval form of Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus (Howard, 1955; Roberson, 2005; Lobl et al., 2008).

T. molitor belongs to the order Coleoptera (beetles) and family Tenebrionidae (common name "darkling beetle"), a cosmopolitan family of beetles with more than 20,000 species. Since the 1950's, researchers have observed that some beetles and larvae in the Tenebrionidae family can damage plastic packaging materials (Gerhardt and Lindgren, 1954; Cline, 1978; Newton, 1988). Subsequently, consumption of PS foams by mealworms was reported by students competing in high school science fairs: in 2003, Ms. Chong-Guan Chen raised mealworms fed PS foam and theorized that the PS biodegraded (Sina, 2003); in 2009, Ms. I-Ching Tseng isolated bacteria from mealworms gut using PS as the sole carbon source (Burkart, 2009). Convincing evidence of PS degradation was reported in mealworms from Beijing, China (Yang et al., 2015a) then in a mealworm strain from a pet store in the United States (Yang et al., 2018). After a 1-2 week adaptation period, the polymer fraction of ingested Styrofoam decreased by up to 65\% with a 12-15 h gut retention time (Yang et al., 2018). Almost half of the ingested PS carbon was converted into \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\) in the mealworm gut (Yang et al., 2015a; Brandon et al., 2018). Isotopic studies using \({ }^{13} \mathrm{C}\)-labeled PS materials have shown that PS was mineralized to \({ }^{13} \mathrm{CO}_{2}\) and incorporated into lipids (Yang et al., 2015a). After being fed with the antibiotic gentamycin, the mealworm strain from Beijing almost completely lost the ability to depolymerize PS and mineralize PS into \(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\), implicating gut bacteria in PS biodegradation (Yang et al., 2015b). Additional studies on the same strains of mealworms isolated a PS-degrading bacteria strain (Exiguobacterium sp.) (Yang et al., 2015b) and indicated that co-feeding with bran resulted in enhanced PS degradation and enabled mealworms to consume PS for multiple generations (Yang et al., 2018).

In this study, we test the hypothesis that PS degradation in mealworms is ubiquitous. Evaluation of this hypothesis is needed because prior work has focused on mealworms from just two sources (Yang et al., 2015a, Yang et al., 2018). To assess plastic biodegradation for mealworms from a broader range of sources, we enlisted the help of academic and non-academic institutions from around the world to collect information about mealworm behavior related to plastic consumption. We also obtained mealworms from 12 different sources and tested them for PS degradation using standard protocols (Yang et al., 2015a, Yang et al., 2018), including PS mass balances to determine the specific rates of PS degradation; (2) gel permeation chromatography (GPC) to assess changes in molecular weight, and (3) Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of frass residues to identify chemical modifications resulting from PS digestion.

We find that mealworms from diverse locations share the ability to consume and degrade PS. We also report observations that add to the existing body of evidence that the gut microbiome plays a role in PS depolymerization and degradation. These microbiomes differ for microorganisms from different sources, with shifts in microbial community structure observed when mealworms are fed PS.

# Source of mealworms

Mealworms (developmental stage: instar 5-7) from the twelve sources (five in the USA, six in China, and one in the United Kingdom) were obtained by: (1) direct purchase from the PetCo Pet Store Chain, Mountain View, California (supplied to the store by Timberline Fisheries); (2) direct purchase from the PetSmart Pet Store Chain, Sunnyvale, California (supplied by Bug Company, Ham Lake, Minnesota); (3) mail order from Timberline Fisheries, Marion, Illinois (ordered separately from source 1); (4) mail order from Exotic Nutrition Pet Company, Newport News, Virginia; (5) mail order from Rainbow Mealworms, Compton, California; (6) direct purchase from a pet store in Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK; (7) direct purchase from a pet store in Beijing; (8) mail order from a store in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province; (9) direct purchase from a mealworm farm in Tai'an County, Shandong Province; (10) direct purchase from a pet store in Xi'an City, Shaanxi Province; (11) direct purchase from a pet store in Shenzhen City, Guangdong Province (Table 1). All larvae were identified as Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus based on morphology and coloration. Prior to arrival, and for at least two days prior to PS degradation tests, the larvae were fed bran and maintained in incubators with bran.

## PS feedstocks

Mealworms received one of three PS feedstocks, labeled A, B, or C. These feedstocks had similar density (0.020–0.021 g cm−3) and similar molecular weights (Table S1, Supplementary data). Average molecular weights of the feedstock materials were determined in the analytical laboratories of the Department of Chemistry, Stanford University. Feedstock A consisted of Styrofoam plates from Insulfoam (Carlisle Construction Materials, Puyallup, WA), the number-average molecular weight (Mn) was 90,000 ± 2,000, and the weight-averaged molecular weight (Mw) was 228,000 ± 1000. Feedstock B consisted of white EPS70 SDN insulation Styrofoam from UK Packaging Suppliers (Staffordshire, UK), with Mn of 89,000 ± 2,000, and Mw of 210,000 ± 2000. Feedstock C consisted of Styrofoam packing material from Shenzhen, China, with Mn of 93,000 ± 3,000, and Mw of 254,000 ± 1000.

## PS biodegradation capability

Mealworms in developmental stages instar 5-7 were cultivated in food grade high density polypropylene (PP) storage containers in laboratories at Stanford, CA, USA; Beijing, China; and Belfast, UK. The set up and methods used were similar to those previously reported (Yang et al., 2018). At Stanford, 120 mealworms were incubated in 475 mL PP containers; in Northern Ireland 200 mealworms were incubated in 600 mL containers; in China, 500 mealworms were incubated in 1200 mL containers. In each incubator, the


The ubiquity of plastic eating behavior among mealworms indicated that mealworms in all locations consumed PS foam, including mealworms from North America (Canada, Mexico, USA); Asia (Cambodia, China, Japan, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, South Korea, Thailand); Europe (Finland, France, Germany, Poland, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey, UK); Africa (Nigeria, South Africa) and Australia. From these results, we surmise that chewing and ingestion of PS is likely an adaptive behavior intrinsic to yellow mealworms, which feed upon decaying forest vegetation in natural settings (Howard, 1955). Marshall School students (Duluth MN, USA) reported 33 mg PS 100 worms \({ }^{-1} \mathrm{~d}^{-1}\), within the range of previous tests; a team at the University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Australia, reported that local mealworms consumed PS at a rate of 13 mg PS 100 worms \({ }^{-1} \mathrm{~d}^{-1}\); a team in Bandar Lampung, Indonesia, reported that PS foam feeds supported mealworm growth, and the feed had no significant effect on larvae mortality (Nukmal et al., 2018); and students reported formation of beetles from larvae when fed PS plus bran, confirming prior reports (Yang et al., 2015a, Yang et al., 2018). Mealworms were also observed consuming PE, an observation now documented in the peer-reviewed literature (Brandon et al., 2018), as well as other plastics, including PVC and PLA, as reported by an academic team in Poland (Bozek et al., 2017).

values were statistically indistinguishable from the 32-day SRs of mealworms fed PS plus bran (Table 1).

Over a 32-day period, SRs for mealworms from US sources 2 through 5 were higher for mealworms fed bran only (88-90%), PS plus bran (85-92%), and PS only (83-92%) than for unfed mealworms (69-76%) (Table 1 and Fig. S2, Table S1). Higher SRs were also observed in mealworms from source 11 (Shanghai) when fed PS plus bran (95%) or PS only (92%) compared to unfed mealworms

(68%) over a 34-day period (Fig. S1C, Table S2).

The average weight of mealworms from source 6 (Northern Ireland) increased by 22% over a 34-day period when fed bran or PS plus bran, but only increased by 7.3% when fed PS alone, and decreased by 8.2% when unfed (Table 1). Similarly, the average weight of mealworms from source 11 (Shanghai) increased by 16-25% over a 34-day period for mealworms fed bran or PS plus bran, but decreased by 9.3% when fed PS alone and by 17.4% when unfed (Table S2, Supplementary data).

These results indicate that digestion of ingested PS can provide significant energy (source 6) and offset energy requirements for maintenance for over one month (source 11). In a previous test of the Beijing strain fed z 13C- and p 13C-labeled PS (Yang et al., 2015a), individual fatty acids had δ 13C values that were significantly higher than bran-fed controls, especially in unsaturated FAs, indicating that 13C from the 13C-labeled PS was assimilated into mealworm biomass. This is evidence that PS digestion can provide both energy and carbon for mealworm maintenance and survival during the first month of cultivation (Yang et al., 2015a, Yang et al., 2018). Further studies are needed to understand the conditions regulating the mechanisms of energy recovery from plastic consumption. Whether the mealworms obtain sufficient energy for maintenance likely depends upon the PS consumption rate and digestibility of the PS consumed.

In the 98-day tests of mealworms from source 6, the SRs of mealworms fed PS alone matched those fed PS plus bran during the initial 35 days of incubation (95.5% versus 98.0%) then dropped to low levels, like those of unfed controls (Table 1). Further investigation revealed that both the unfed mealworms and mealworms fed PS alone engaged in cannibalism. The 98-day SR was 11.8 ± 1.1% for unfed mealworms, and 11.5 ± 4.9% for mealworms fed PS alone. By contrast, the 98-day SR for mealworms fed bran plus PS was 81.5 ± 7.1% (Fig. S1B). Because PS contains only hydrogen and carbon, it does not provide adequate nutrition (N, P, Na, K, trace elements, amino acids, etc.) for a long-term survival and growth. The positive effect of PS on SR does not last for long time due to the lack of nitrogen sources and other nutrients. The addition of bran relieved this constraint. In the absence of added bran, however, PS-fed mealworms survived by consuming dead mealworms and their molts. The survivors (about 12% of the original population) maintained a biomass similar to those that received bran (Table 1).

Specific PS consumption rates from US sources 1-6 and Northern Ireland UK source 7 were compared for mealworms fed PS alone and bran plus PS (Table 1). Mealworms fed bran plus PS typically consumed PS at rates that were more than twice those of mealworms fed PS alone. Not surprisingly, mealworms from sources 1 and 2 (same source, but different batch) had similar PS specific consumption rates. The initial size of the mealworms had no clear impact on the rate of PS consumption, but the lightest mealworms (source 6; average weight 33.5 mg) consumed PS at the highest rate (7.64 mg PS g worms \({ }^{-1} \mathrm{~d}^{-1}\) ).

For the mealworms obtained in China, PS consumption rates were evaluated under relatively optimal conditions. While the results varied, the ranges observed were similar to those of mealworms from the USA and North Ireland (Table 1).

\subsection*{3.3. Characterizations of the egested frass}

During incubation with PS as a feedstock, decreases in \(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{n}}\) and \(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{w}}\) and MWD shifts to were monitored (Albertsson et al., 1998; Yang et al., 2015a, Yang et al., 2018). Fig. 3 shows evidence of PS depolymerization within the guts of mealworms from all 12 sources, with significant decreases in \(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{n}}\) and \(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{w}}\) accompanied by shifts in MWD to lower molecular weights (t-test \(p<0.05\) in Table S2).

Frass samples from mealworms from US sources 1-5 and Chinese sources 7-11 contained polymer extracts with \(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{n}}\) values that were 9.1-15.6\% lower than the feedstock and had \(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{w}}\) values that were 5.2-10.8\% lower than the feedstock (Feedstock A with \(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{n}}\) of \(90,000 \pm 2000 ; \mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{w}}\) of \(228,000 \pm 1000\) ) (Table S3, Supplementary data). Frass samples from mealworms from Northern Ireland (source 6) had \(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{n}}\) values that were 5.4\% lower and \(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{w}}\) values that were 12.1\% lower than the feed (Feedstock B with \(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{n}}\) of \(89,000 \pm 2000 ; \mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{w}}\) of \(210,000 \pm 2000\) ). For frass samples from Chinese source 12, \(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{n}}\) values were 11.2\% lower, and \(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{w}}\) values were 9.0\% lower than the feed (Feedstock C with \(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{n}}\) of \(93,000 \pm 3000\) and \(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{w}}\) of \(254,000 \pm 1000\) (Table S3). These decreases in \(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{n}}\) and \(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{w}}\) were significant for all sources (t-test, \(p<0.05\), Table S2), indicating depolymerization and degradation of PS feedstock was ubiquitous across all 12 source populations.

FTIR analyses verified the formation of new functional groups during passage through the mealworm gut. Comparison of FTIR spectra for the PS feed stock (control) and egested frass of all tested mealworms showed chemical changes and incorporation of oxygen previously linked to plastic degradation (Fig. 4 A and 4B, Fig. S3 and S4, Supplementary data). These data are similar to those previously reported (Yang et al., 2018; Brandon et al., 2018). The spectra of frass from mealworms fed with PS and PS plus bran are significantly different from the frass of mealworms fed bran only (Fig. 4A and Fig. S3, Supplementary data). Peaks at 625-970 cm \({ }^{-1}\) (ring-bending vibration) had high intensities in the PS feedstock but were much weaker in frass samples. Peaks characteristic of the PS benzene ring (C=C stretch, 1550-1610 and 1800-2000 cm \({ }^{-1}\) ) were dampened in frass of mealworms fed PS or PS plus bran, suggesting ring cleavage. The PS fed samples showed a decrease intensity for peaks characteristic of PS (Sekhar et al., 2016) and appearance of more carbonyl groups (C=O stretching, 1700 cm \({ }^{-1}\) ) compared with samples fed bran alone or PS feedstock (Fig. 4A and B, Fig. S3, Supplementary data). The broadening of peaks at 2500-3500 cm \({ }^{-1}\) in all FTIR spectra is associated with the hydrogen bond of hydroxyl groups and/or carboxylic acid groups, suggesting a shift from hydrophobic to more hydrophilic surface properties. FTIR analysis confirmed that all frass samples showed strong signs of PS biodegradation, as observed in previous tests of mealworms from Beijing (Yang et al., 2015a) and a California PetCo store (Yang et al., 2018).

The dominant bacterial phyla across all mealworm samples, representing greater than 99% average relative abundance in the measured bacterial communities, were Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Tenericutes. The six most abundant families (>98% total relative abundance on average) were Bacillaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Leuconostocaceae, and Streptococcaceae, representing a diverse range of mostly aerobic and/or facultative bacteria. Fig. 5 illustrates differences in bacterial taxa between mealworms fed normal feed bran (Original) and mealworms fed PS alone and PS plus bran (PS/Bran). The original bacterial communities varied greatly between source populations, likely due to differences in diet at different geographic locations and strain-specific properties (genes, growth condition and history). However, after mealworms switched diets from bran to PS plus bran or to PS alone, the gut microbial communities converged on similar patterns independent of the mealworm source.

At the phylum level, the relative abundance of Firmicutes decreased significantly in the PS-only diets (P = 0.0055) and the PS plus bran diet (Wilcoxon, P = 0.0035). There were no significant differences between the PS-only diet and the PS plus bran diet (P = 0.293). Firmicutes include Clostridia (anaerobic bacteria) and Bacilli (aerobic bacteria), and both are spore formers. No other phyla were significantly different between treatments though Proteobacteria abundance showed an inverse relationship with Firmicutes (Fig. 5A). At the family level, Enterobacteriaceae represented 33.7% (SE ± 6.3%) of total relative abundance in the original diet, 64.6 ± 12.5% in the PS-only diet, and 50.2 ± 6.5% in the PS plus bran diet (Fig. 5B). After adjusting P values for multiple comparisons, there were no significant differences in relative abundance of any family. At the genus level, Erwinia was the most prevalent genus, representing 25.3 ± 5.65% in the original treatment, 49.1 ± 17.6% in the PS-only treatment, and 31.2 ± 5.64% in the PS plus bran treatment, with no significant differences between diets (Fig. 5C).

When the diet of the mealworms shifted from bran to PS-only or PS plus bran, the gut microbiota shifted to a community with improved capabilities for PS degradation. At present, however, it is difficult to prove which microbial genera or families are responsible for enhanced PS degradation because only a few PS-degrading bacteria have been isolated. These include PS-degrading Exiguobacterium sp. YT2 (Yang et al., 2015b), Phylum: Firmicutes; Class Bacilli, and Rhodococcus ruber (Mor and Siva, 2008), Phylum Actinobacteria, Family Nocardiaceae. Recently, Tang et al. (2017) reported two bacterial strains isolated from the guts of mealworms and superworms' that are capable of growing on PS - Aeromonas sp and Klebsiella pneumoniae - both of which belong to the family Enterobacteriaceae (P Proteobacteria, C Gammaproteobacteria). It is reasonable to hypothesize that PS-degrading bacteria are able to secrete extracellular oxidative enzyme(s) that break down PS polymer chains and generate intermediates with C=O bonds; features present in broad families of aerobic or facultative bacteria. Additional isolation and characterization of PS-degrading species is needed to enable identification of key functional enzymes involved in the depolymerization and biodegradation of PS, PE and other plastics. Given the shifts in taxonomic composition that occurred after the mealworms were fed a diet containing PS, this work suggests that bacteria responsible for depolymerizing PS and degradation of intermediates likely include Gram-positive Clostridia (anaerobic conditions), Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae (anaerobic-aerobic conditions) and Gram-positive Bacillus (aerobic conditions).

The results of this study indicate that microbiomes capable of depolymerizing PS are widely present in mealworm gut from various sources and that shifts in gut microbial communities may be a direct result of PS consumption (i.e. a changing community to better degrade plastics) or an indirect response (i.e. a response to nutrient deprivation due to the limited diet). We did not evaluate changes in the gut microbial community under starvation conditions and additional studies of such conditions are warranted.

\subsection*{3.6. Significance of the ubiquity of PS degradation by mealworms}

The results of the global survey strongly suggest that mealworm ingestion of plastic foams, like Styrofoam, is genetically-

programmed and ubiquitous. Rapid PS depolymerization was observed, as observed previously (Yang et al., 2015a, Yang et al., 2018), and this capability is apparently conserved in mealworm populations throughout the world. These mealworm populations ingest and use PS foam as a food (energy) source for survival, and this behavior is not limited to PS: PE can be consumed even more rapidly than PS. Approximately 49.0 ± 1.4% of ingested PE was converted into a putative gas fraction (i.e., CO2) (Brandon et al., 2018). Evidence of mealworm consumption is now available for many other materials, including PP, PVC, PET and PUR at laboratories in the USA and China (data not shown). Other academic researchers have reported mealworm consumption of PVC and PLA (Bozek et al., 2017).

Chewing of plastic into small fragments increases the surface area of the ingested plastic and thus likely enhances enzymatic depolymerization, but depolymerization of the ingested plastic was not completed in the 14–18 h transit time through the mealworm gut. Residual PS in the frass contributes to the THF extractable fraction, constituting ~35% of the weight of frass (Yang et al., 2018). Further testing is needed to determine whether this residual is recalcitrant, say, for example, because of crystallinity differences in the PS feedstock, or whether this PS could be degraded with additional residence time in the mealworm gut. In any case, this work establishes that ingestion of PS and PE plastic foam can provide energy for maintenance of mealworm populations for 4–5 weeks. However, a sustained diet of plastic without supplemental nutrition does not enable reproduction of mealworms (Yang et al., 2018) and eventually leads to canibalism.

The ability of insects to depolymerize diverse plastics is likely ubiquitous and not restricted to mealworms. The fact that insect pests, including darkling beetles (Tribolium castaneum, Rhizopertha Lasioderma serricorne, Tenebrio mauretanicus, Zophobas morio etc. in family Tenebrionidae) and several moths and their larvae (Plodia interpunctella, Galleria mellonella in the Family Pyralidae) can chew, eat, and penetrate various plastic packaging materials has been established since the 1950s (Gerhardt and Lindgren, 1954; Cline, 1978; Newton, 1988; Bombelli et al., 2017). These early studies established that insect larvae chew and damage PE, PVC and polyester films regardless of whether the film was used to cover food (Cline, 1978), suggesting that the larvae of insect pests may also ingest plastics as food. Recent studies indicated that the larvae of Plodia interpunctella (Indian meal moth) and Galleria mellonella, or honey waxworms, can chew and likely degrade PE films (Yang et al., 2014; Bombelli et al., 2017).

\section*{4. Conclusions}

This work establishes that mealworms have an intrinsic capacity for biodegradation of PS due to their intrinsic eating and chewing behaviors and gut microbe-dependent oxidative digestive machinery. Digestion of PS contribute to the energy needs of the mealworms. These features appear to be ubiquitous within mealworms from diverse geographic locations and can be enhanced by co-feeding of nutrient sources such as bran. The contributing gut microbial communities are diverse and subject to dietary control.
