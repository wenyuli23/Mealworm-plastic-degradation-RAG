#### Abstract
Insects used to treat organic waste streams and produce valuable protein products are increasingly exposed to plastic contaminated source material assimilating plastic carbon into organic biomass, which is pervasive and hazardous to organisms. Our understanding of this increased insect-plastic interaction remains limited and needs urgent scientific attention if plastic biodegradation and production rates of quality protein are to be improved. Herein, we investigated the biochemical impact of various plastics using three insect models. Black Soldier Fly (BSF), Mealworm (MW), and Wax Moth (WM) larvae were each exposed to a plastic substrate (PET, PE, PS, Expanded PE, PP, and PLA) as the primary carbon source for five days to explore any positive metabolic benefits in terms of insect performance and plastic degradation potential. Central carbon metabolism (CCM) metabolites were analyzed via a targeted tMRM liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-QqQ-MS) method. Unique expressed pathways were observed for each insect model. When reared on PET, BSF larvae were found to have an elevated pyrimidine metabolism, while the purine metabolism pathway was strongly expressed on other plastics. BSF also exhibited a downregulated Vitamin B6 metabolism across all plastics, indicating a likely gut-symbiont breakdown. The MW and WM model insects were metabolically more active on PLA and expanded foam plastics. Further, WM exhibited an elevation in Vitamin B6 metabolism. This data suggests a positive insect-specific interaction towards certain plastic types that warrants further investigation.

1. Introduction

Global plastic production and its waste accumulation are exceeding recycling and biodegradation rates (Lebreton and Andrady, 2019). Characteristic plastics have various degrees of biodegradability; however, all plastic is considered a source of carbon (fossil fuel derived) and is continuously degraded and comminuted into smaller particles over time (Zhu, 2021). This accumulation of plastic carbon particles in the environment is pervasive and poses a hazard to organisms (Allen et al., 2020; Lim, 2021). Further, plastic particles cause numerous downstream organic waste processing problems, where the end product is often intended as compost (Kawecki et al., 2021), feedstock (Tonini et al., 2021), or producing insects used for food and animal feed (Braun et al., 2021). It is here that the assimilation of plastic carbon into insect biomass can occur, among other transportation pathways (Lusher et al., 2017; Taipale et al., 2019).

The ability of some insects to consume different waste substrates (including plastics) and effectively convert plastic carbon into viable and valuable protein is a specific focus being explored by researchers globally, not only as a means of addressing growing global plastic waste reserves but also as a source of nutrition (Ites et al., 2020; Mertenat et al., 2019; Salomone et al., 2017; Scala et al., 2020; van Huis, 2020; Wynants et al., 2019). Typically, plastic waste occurs as a chemical and physical contaminant, which pervades all environments, making it inevitable that invertebrates will come into physical contact with plastic carbon and most likely ingest it (Oliveira et al., 2019). Waste management systems that apply insects to process organic waste (i.e., supermarket waste etc.) require paper and plastic packaging to be removed during the de-packaging phase of treatment (Ites et al., 2020). Their introduction into the organic waste stream is viewed to negatively impact nutrient availability, which plays a significant role in insect phenology, development, and behaviour (Chapman, 1998). Moreover, such contaminants can negatively impact organic waste conversion efficiencies and process retention times (e.g., process throughput and quality of end products). Therefore, confirming how insects respond to different plastic sources and their fate if consumed will be important knowledge to obtain if insects are to be considered a legitimate source of protein to supplement or replace traditional protein sources (van Huis, 2020; van Huis et al., 2021). Furthermore, identifying which insects are equipped and capable of biotransforming specific plastic types will help to develop fit-for-purpose insect biotransformers matched to beneficial plastic carbon substrates. One avenue to explore this interaction is via metabolomics, specifically through the analysis of central carbon metabolism (CCM) metabolites.

The CCM metabolites comprise a suite of compounds within the most basic cellular pathways present in all living organisms (Bar-Even et al., 2012). CCM facilitates numerous biosynthetic and metabolic pathways in response to nutrient availability and helps to direct available nutrients for various physiological requirements (Matsuda et al., 2017). The profile of CCM metabolites can therefore provide important information on how metabolic processes are being activated, and the deviation from normal processes during health, disease, and environmental perturbation (Beale et al., 2021; Beale et al., 2022; Shah et al., 2019; Shah et al., 2021; Siegel et al., 2014). In addition, previous studies have shown that CCM is involved in a myriad of pathways connected to nutrient availability and show how organisms, such as insects, can divert or partition functions to compensate or maintain essential metabolic services in response to nutrient-limited environments or changes to nutrient availability (Ankrah et al., 2020). This is particularly pertinent when exploring the biochemical perturbations caused by plastics and affords the analysis of CCM as an effective tool to explore the interplay between plastic as a resource and insect metabolic processes. Here we used targeted CCM metabolomics to measure the larvae response of three different insect species when exposed to different classes of plastic during larval development. The three insects under study were: Black Soldier Fly (BSF), Mealworm (MW) and Greater Wax Moth (WM).

The three insect candidates, one from each of three orders Diptera, Lepidoptera and Coleoptera, are well studied; and MW and WM have been shown to degrade different plastics (Billen et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2021a; Yang et al., 2021b). Depending on the species, insects are more effective and efficient at food conversion to protein, which is suitable for livestock feed and food, requiring less space, water, and energy. As such, insects are increasingly recognised as sustainable mini livestock (van Huis, 2020). Further, the candidates here have relatively short lifecycles, fast growth rates and are easy to rear on a range of organic food stuffs that make them suitable for large scale production. BSF larvae are cosmopolitan and applied to upcycle many organic substrates. Compared to WM and MW, BSF lack well developed mandibles and are less likely to chew plastic and make an interesting contrast that focuses degradation potential on enzymes (Bruno et al., 2020). WM consumes large amounts of bee wax and may give them an advantage to metabolize substances such as plastics (Kong et al., 2019). Bee wax contains a range of chemical compounds including alkanes and alkenes (Hepburn et al., 2014). Mealworm (MW) is the most investigated larval model in plastic biodegradation (Pivato et al., 2022), and it has been proposed as a model in micro- and nanoplastic toxicity (Sanchez-Hernandez, 2021). Furthermore, the frass of MW and WM has a high potential in sustainable agriculture as an organic fertilizer (Houben et al., 2020; Watson et al., 2021), thus increasing the interest of mealworms in multiple environmental services.

Further, the CCM data will provide insight to which insect have a positive metabolic response to various plastics and direct future research to how insects can be used as a plastic waste biotransformer.

2. Material and methods

2.1. Model insects

Hermetia illucens, BSF, were sourced from Goterra® (Canberra, ACT, Australia). BSF was reared for four generations at the CSIRO Insect Laboratory (Ecosciences Precinct, Dutton Park, Brisbane, Australia) in a constant environment room (CER) set at a 14:10 h Light-Dark (LD) cycle, with a 60% relative humidity (RH) at 26 °C. BSF eggs hatched, and neonates reared on a mix of 50% Barastoc golden yolk® poultry pellets (Melbourne, VIC, Australia) and wheat bran (supermarket sourced) that was mixed with deionised distilled (DI) water. Four-day-old larvae were then transferred to a diet of commercially sourced mixed vegetables and milk powder. Galleria mellonella, WM, was procured from the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries (DAF) colony which had been in culture for >30 plus generations and then reared for three generations at the CSIRO Insect Laboratory in a CER set at 14:10 LD 50% RH 26 °C. WM was reared in one-litre glass jars and fed a mix of commercially sourced yeast, honey, glycerol and Farex® baby cereal, the same diet used by DAF. Tenebrio molitor, MW, were purchased from Pisces® commercial pet food supplier (Brisbane, Australia) then reared for two generations at the CSIRO Insect Laboratory in a CER set at 14:10 LD 50% RH 26 °C. MW was reared in open stainless-steel dishes and fed on wheat bran, fresh carrot, and sweet potato.

2.2. Artificial feeding of plastic

The impact of different common plastics on insect metabolism was evaluated in a controlled plastic-insect exposure study (Fig. 1). Larvae for each insect was exposed to plastic alone or plastic supplemented (coated) with a supplement, namely molasses:water (50:50, v/v) and air-dried overnight which left a film over the

### 2.4. Central carbon metabolism (CCM)

CCM metabolites were extracted from freeze-dried whole insect larvae using a modified extraction method (Gyawali et al., 2021). Briefly, 20 mg of freeze-dried biomass was reconstituted with 100 μL MilliQ Water and combined with 450 μL of ice-cold (-20 °C) methanol:ethanol (50% v/v; LiChrosolv®; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) spiked with 1 ppm Succinic Acid \({ }^{13} \mathrm{C}_{2}\) (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., Tewksbury, MA, USA) and vortexed for 2 min. The samples were centrifuged (Centrifuge 5430R, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) at 14,000 g for 4 min. The supernatant was transferred and filtered using a positive pressure manifold (Agilent PPM48 Processor, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) with Captiva EMR cartridges (40 mg, 1 mL; Agilent Technologies, Australia) to remove the lipid fraction. The cartridges were then washed with two 200 μL aliquots of MilliQ water:methanol:ethanol (2:1:1, v/v/v). The combined filtered supernatant and cartridge washes, representing the insect polar CCM metabolite fraction, were combined in a 1.5 mL high recovery vial (30 μL reservoir, silanized glass vials, Agilent Technologies, Australia) and dried in a SpeedVac (10 mbar). The metabolite fraction was reconstituted with 100 μL MilliQ water:methanol (4:1, v/v) spiked with 100 ppb of L-Phenylalanine (1-13C). CCM metabolites were measured on an Agilent Infinity Flex II UHPLC coupled to an Agilent 6470 Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (QqQ-MS) as previously reported (Gyawali et al., 2021) and Sartain (2016). The residual relative standard deviation (RSD) of the internal standards were 3.16% (Succinic Acid, 1,4-13C2) and 1.98% (L-Phenylalanine, 1-13C). Procedural blanks (n = 6) and pooled biological samples (n = 6) were randomly dispersed throughout the sequence.

### 2.5. Statistical analysis

CCM data were first 'blank' subtracted, normalised to the spiked internal standard (Succinic Acid \({ }^{13} \mathrm{C}_{2}\)) and sample biomass (20 mg). Features with >50% missing values per treatment group were removed, and any remaining missing values were replaced with 1/5 of the minimum positive value for each variable. In total, 171 central carbon metabolism metabolites were measured across all insect samples (Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2 provide an overview of the model insect control groups). The acquired data were then normalised by the sample median, log10-transformed, and scaled using the mean-centered value and divided by the standard deviation of each variable. Data were then subjected to univariate and multivariate statistical analysis using MetaboAnalyst 5.0 (Pang et al., 2021) and SIMCA 17.01 (Sartorius AG, Goettingen, Germany). Pathway impact analysis and enrichment were performed in MetaboAnalyst 5.0 using the model insect Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) KEGG database. Significant metabolites were identified using a fold change threshold ≥ 1.5, and a p-value ≤ 0.05; pathway impact is determined from a pathway topology analysis and its the cumulative percentage from the matched metabolite nodes (Pang et al., 2021).

## 3. Results and discussion

### 3.1. Effect of exposure to plastic on insect larva weight and survival

There were subtle effects of treatment on larval weights across treatments and insects (Table 2). The mean larval weights (±SD) of surviving larvae across all treatments were 97.0 ± 20.9 mg, 102.4 ± 20.6 mg, and 37.2 ± 13.0 g for BSF, MW, and WM, respectively. Mean larval weights were not significantly different between control treatments and plastic treatments regardless of supplementation, apart from BSF on PLA with supplement. This treatment returned a 28.7% reduction in mean larval weight compared to that of the supplemented control treatment (p-value = 0.0231). There was a significant effect of supplementation on WM mean larval weights with supplemented larva exhibiting a 13.2% reduction in weight (p-value = 0.014 unpaired t-test; p-value = 0.0075 paired t-test).

Treatment did not affect the percentage survival of BSF or MW (Table 2). BSF and MW larva recorded 100 and 97.1% survival respectively. While there was no effect of the plastic treatment on WM survival, there was a significant effect of supplementation (p-value = 0.0022); supplemented MW larva displayed 90.0% survival whereas the rate for unsupplemented WM was 61.4%. While the focus of the work herein was to determine the metabolic effect of exposure to plastic, more work is needed to assess the impact of exposure for longer periods in terms of fitness variables (i.e., ability to complete larvae development, time to complete development, adult size, mating, etc.).

#### 3.2.1. Black Soldier Fly

The supervised orthogonal partial least squares-data analysis (OPLS-DA) statistics revealed that BSF fed on different plastic shared a high degree

of similarity in terms of expressed metabolites after 5 days of exposure (Supplementary Fig. S3A), clustering into 4 groups. Groups consisted: Group 1 (PET); Group 2 (Exp PE); Group 3 (PE, PS, PP, and PLA); and the control cohort (Group 4). The loadings plot is indicative of the metabolites contributing to the separation of the differing CCM towards these groups (Supplementary Fig. S3B); 21 metabolites were differentially expressed (elevated or depleted, FC > 1.5), while 15 were statistically significant (p-value < 0.05; Supplementary Fig. S4).

Pathway enrichment and impact analysis of the 15 significantly differential metabolites (Fig. 2) indicated altered expression in several metabolic pathways involving nucleic acids, amino acids such as alanine, aspartate, glutamate, arginine and proline, and butanoate (via 4-aminobutanoate) and vitamin B6 (via pyridoxine) (Fig. 2). While most of these pathways were found to be upregulated in the PET treatment, vitamin B6 metabolism was observed to be downregulated in all plastic treatments with respect to the control group.

Vitamin B6 is a known co-factor in several other biochemical reactions of which 140 downstream pathways are involved (Parra et al., 2018), including fatty acid synthesis. Depletion of key intermediates such as pyridoxine and 4-pyridoxate, combined with elevated γ-aminobutyrate (GABA) indicate potential Vitamin B6 and Ala-Asp-Glu metabolic pathways pooling via GABA intermediates and increased fatty acid synthesis (Huang et al., 2016). N-acetyl galactosamine (NAcGal) and uridine 5-diphosphate (UDP) are known to be the precursors of nucleotide sugars. These precursors are metabolised by microbial UDP-galactopyranose mutase to form glycosphospholipids which are required for microbial adhesion (Lamarre et al., 2009), and antigenic signalling in insects (Ichimiya et al., 2015). Combined with the observations of Gravelat et al. (2013) and elevated GABA, NAcGal and UDP levels, our study suggests that an increased trans-trans-muconic acid, potentially originating from plastic polymers (Seow et al., 2012), which may have aided towards elevated synthesis of UDP-galactopyranose related glycosphospholipids by gut microbes. Interestingly, elevated trans-trans-muconic acid and 4-aminobenzoic acid suggested plastic degradation activity (Myhrstad et al., 2020) in the insect gut, as was reported from earthworms (Huerta Lwangwa et al., 2018). However, more research on the insect microbiome contribution is needed to ascertain this phenomenon for the insects under study here.

Further, the presence of plastic appeared to cause an oxidative stress in BSF. Elevated homocysteine (glutathione metabolism intermediate) and 4-aminobenzoic acid, combined with a downregulated pyrimidine and upregulated purine metabolism was observed. This suggests a switch from purine metabolism, which is aimed at generating the necessary substrates for basic cellular processes (Pedley and Benkovic, 2017), towards pyrimidine metabolism. The effects of oxidative stress caused by plastics, resulting in upregulated stress response pathways such as glutathione metabolism, combined with perturbed nucleotide metabolism has been shown recently in marine microbiota (Ye et al., 2021a) and Zebrafish microbiota (Dimitriadi et al., 2021). Further, oxidative stress, inflammation, and metabolic alterations due to plastics have been observed in other aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates (Sanchez-Hernandez, 2021), impacting a wide variety of cellular responses and linked to immune response. However, further insect microbiota-based studies are needed to shed more light on this mechanism for the insect models herein with a specific focus on biomarkers of oxidative stress and plastic toxicity.

\subsection*{3.2.2. Mealworm}

Unlike BSF, the supplement had a significant influence on the sample clustering among MW. The effect of the supplement was to enhance clustering within treatments and improve discrimination between treatments (data not shown). Thus, further analyses were applied to the metabolomic data from the supplement treatments only.

Three distinct clusters between the various treatments were observed (Supplementary Fig. S5), with discrimination between a grouping formed by the insect metabolomes of the PET, PS, and Exp PE (combined), and the PLA and Control treatment clusters. Of the 33 differentially expressed metabolites across the clusters (FC > 1.5), 24 were observed to be statistically significant. While guanine and L-dihydroorotic acid were downregulated, the remaining 22 metabolites were upregulated (Supplementary Fig. S6).

MW showed upregulated starch and sucrose metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar pathway, as demonstrated by the elevated sugar phosphates, nucleotide sugars in addition to N-acetyl glucosamine (NAcGlu) and glucosamine 6-phosphate. Furthermore, synthesis of cofactors such as β-nicotinamide adenine nucleotide (β-NAD) and flavin adenine nucleotide (FAD) elevated via elevated purine metabolism intermediates (Fig. 3).

The cofactor accumulation in combination with upregulated PPP and purine metabolism and elevated 3-dehydroshikimate indicate an altered

3.3. Plastic weight losses post exposure to insect larva

Every attempt was made to measure the plastic material post exposure to insect larva using a common plastic accounting measurement method used for the measurement of microplastics in waste effluents (Ye et al., 2021b). This was done to measure the magnitude of plastic lost during the experiment (post 5 days), if any, per surviving insect larva. As illustrated in Fig. 5, PET, PE, PS, Exp PE and PLA when un-supplemented (in addition to PE supplemented) exposed to BSF larva exhibited varying degrees of plastic loss. However, with the exception to the PE plastics, the reliability of measurement was outside the acceptable thresholds for reporting (i.e., the error was more than 15%). This could be an artefact of the sample preparation protocol reducing the plastic mass and causing consequential losses. In any case, these data are annotated with an asterisk and the magnitude of loss is maintained at \(-0.5\) mg per surviving insect larva to illustrate a loss was observed, although the reporting error indicates this loss is much higher. More work is needed to ensure reliable plastic weights are consistently obtained, prior to and post-exposure. Similarly, unsupplemented WM on PE and (supplemented) PS demonstrated significant plastic loss post-exposure. PET, PLA and supplemented PE and Exp PE were lower in mass but not reliably measured and annotated with an asterisk. PET, PS, and Exp PE exposed to MW for 5 days were measured at a significantly lower mass. These observations anecdotaly correlate with the CCM data described above. Yet, it is acknowledged that a more reliable plastic measurement is needed to establish these links in CCM measurements with key physical insect performance metrics (weight and survival rates) coupled with observed plastic measurements.

4. Summary of findings

These data suggest the ability of each insect to perform important functions via alternate pathways when reared on a plastic substrate. The addition of a food supplement, here molasses, ultimately had a net positive impact in terms of energy utilisation for the MW and WM insect models, as demonstrated by an increased survival rate for WM and better sample groupings in the supervised multivariate analysis when supplemented compared to the unsupplemented equivalent. However, the addition of the supplement had no significant difference to the BSF model insects on plastic.

The BSF larvae had a positive metabolic interaction with the PET, a negative/neutral interaction with the expanded Exp PE plastic. Similarly, the MW and WM model insects, particularly WM, performed well in terms of CCM outputs when on PLA and foam-based plastics. This may be a result of the insects' ability to degrade the plastic into small particles and exhibit a positive gut microbiome interaction as a result. The positive CCM correlation with specific plastics types is summarised in Fig. 6 and is indicative of plastic substrates that warrant further investigation using further analytical approaches (such as lipidomics, microbiome compositional analysis, and detailed plastic degradation assessments). These approaches will provide information related to the assimilation and potential conversion of plastics into insect biomass.

4.1. Study limitations and benefits

The current study provides valuable biochemical insight into the impacts plastic has on insect CCM metabolites. However, it is acknowledged that the study is not without limitations. For example, the insect biomass variance within treatments and across treatment groups (both with and without supplement) is a significant limitation of this study. While 10 larvae were used per jar, the weight distribution variance at the end of the experiment varied as much as 25% between individual larvae. It is noted that the Metabolomics Standard Initiative guideline documents for minimum reporting standards for biological samples set a minimum number of biological replicates to three (n = 3) per treatment group (Sumner et al., 2007). While we meet this requirement for the insects harvested from all treatment jars, the biochemical changes across the total biomass distribution may bias these results due to the weight variation observed. To overcome this limitation and facilitate a qualitative omics assessment of measurable CCM biomolecules, all
