#### ABSTRACT:
Biodegradation of polystyrene (PS) in mealworms (Tenebrio molitor larvae) has been identified with commercial PS foams. However, there is currently limited understanding of the influence of molecular weight (MW) on insect-mediated plastic biodegradation and the corresponding responses of mealworms. In this study, we provided the results of PS biodegradation, gut microbiome, and metabolome by feeding mealworms with high-purity PS microplastics with a wide variety of MW. Over 24 days, mealworms (50 individuals) fed with 0.20 g of PS showed decreasing removal of 74.1 ± 1.7, 64.1 ± 1.6, 64.4 ± 4.0, 73.5 ± 0.9, 60.6 ± 2.6, and 39.7 ± 4.3% for PS polymers with respective weight-average molecular weights (Mw) of 6.70, 29.17, 88.63, 192.9, 612.2, and 1346 kDa. The mealworms degraded most PS polymers via broad depolymerization but ultrahigh-MW PS via limited-extent depolymerization. The gut microbiome was strongly associated with biodegradation, but that with low- and medium-MW PS was significantly distinct from that with ultrahigh-MW PS. Metabolomic analysis indicated that PS biodegradation reprogrammed the metabolome and caused intestinal dysbiosis depending on MW. Our findings demonstrate that mealworms alter their gut microbiome and intestinal metabolic pathways in response to in vivo biodegradation of PS polymers of various MWs.

## INTRODUCTION
The accumulation of plastic waste in the environment is a well-known risk to human and environmental health. High demand for six major polymers, i.e., polystyrene (PS, 6.1%), poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET, 8.4%), polyurethane (PUR, 7.8%), poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC, 9.6%), polypropylene (PP, 19.7%), and polyethylene (PE, 31.3%), has pushed the production of petroleum-derived polymers to near 370 million metric tons in 2020.1 Projections indicate that plastic pollution will even treble by 2040 under a business-as-usual scenario.2 PS, chemically expressed as [-CH-(C6H5)CH2-]n, is not structurally complex as other polymers, with no differing chain branching structure and diverse crystallinity.3,4 Commercial PS products are mainly atactic polymers, in which the phenyl groups are randomly distributed on both sides of the polymer chain, including expanded PS (EPS) used for building insulation, packing, etc.; extruded PS (XPS) used for food containers, coffee cups, etc.; and high-impact polystyrene (HIPS) for liquid containers, toys, etc. The random positioning of the atactic PS prevents the chains from aligning with enough regularity to achieve any crystallinity, making PS different from other major polymers. Syndiotactic polystyrene (SPS), which is produced by adding different additives and varying the degree of polymerization for different commercial applications, is applied at a limited level. Plastic additives are added to PS products for various applications, but they impact plastic biodegradability.5-7 PS is also one of the major sources of plastic waste entering the environment, including plastic solid waste, microplastics (MPs), and nanoplastics (NPs).4,8-10

Research on plastic biodegradation via microbial and enzymatic approaches has been performed since the 1970s.11-13 Microbial biodegradation of plastics in the environment is considered extremely slow, taking months or even years.8 The physicochemical properties of polymers impact biodegradation, with the major influencing factors

The table presents the characterization of molecular weight (MW) changes of polystyrene (PS) microplastics (MPs) after passing through the larval intestinal tract of mealworms. The data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation, with \(n=3\). The MW is characterized by weight-average molecular weight \(\left(M_{w}\right)\), number-average molecular weight \(\left(M_{n}\right)\), and size-average molecular weight \(\left(M_{c}\right)\). The table shows that the MW of PS MPs decreases significantly after passing through the larval intestinal tract, with the largest decrease occurring in the weight-average MW. The polydispersity index (PDI) also decreases, indicating a narrower molecular weight distribution. The results suggest that the gut microbiome of mealworms plays a significant role in the degradation of PS MPs.

\section*{Experimental Design of PS Consumption and Biodegradation.} Eight experimental groups with triplicates were tested to evaluate the consumption and biodegradation of PS in mealworms under eight feeding conditions, i.e., PS-1, PS-2, PS-3, PS-4, PS-5, PS-6, bran, and starvation (St). The experimental procedures and conditions followed previously established protocols. \({ }^{17}\) Glass containers \((11.2 \mathrm{~cm} \times 11.2 \mathrm{~cm} \times 5.5 \mathrm{~cm})\) contained 50 mealworms initially, with a population density of 0.4 mealworms \(\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\). All containers were kept in a laboratory thermostatic incubator at a temperature of \(25 \pm 0.5\) \({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) and a humidity of \(70 \pm 5 \%\).

Respective PS MPs (0.20 g) were added to each PS-fed container. The mealworms in the bran-fed containers were fed with 0.20 g of bran initially and then supplemented with 0.20 g every 8 days. At the end of the 24-day test, the final weight and survival rate (SR) were measured. The specific PS consumption rate (SPCR) and frass yield (ratio of frass vs PS MPs consumed) were determined after all PS MPs were completely consumed. In this study, we chose 24 days as the test duration because petroleum-based plastics (PS, PE, PP, etc.) can provide carbon and energy sources to support the healthy life activities of the larvae for about 3-5 weeks. \({ }^{6,17-19,22,25}\) To obtain sufficient frass for analysis, more containers were prepared under the same conditions (SI M2). The calculation procedure was documented in SI M3.

\section*{PS Removal and Depolymerization Pattern.} The PS-fed frass was collected to determine the water-extracted fraction \(\left(C_{w}\right)\), ethanol-extracted fraction \(\left(C_{e}\right)\), and THF-extracted fraction \(\left(C_{t}\right)\) which were used to estimate the residual PS content. \({ }^{17}\) The PS removal was calculated based on the total mass of PS consumed, the mass of frass generated, and the residual PS content in the frass (SI M4).

To characterize the change in MW and PS depolymerization pattern, gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis was performed to determine \(M_{w}, M_{n}, M_{p}\), PDI, and MWD of the residual PS vs original PS MPs. The GPC analysis was performed at an ambient temperature with THF as the solvent (eluent flow rate: \(0.8 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{~min}^{-1}\) ). Detailed methods were documented in SI M5.

\section*{Microbial Community and Metabolomic Analysis.} To investigate the gut microbiome and metabolome, the mealworms were raised as described for the biodegradation tests. After 3 weeks, the mealworms fed with PS-1 \(\left(M_{w}\right.\) of 6.70 kDa; called PS-L), PS-4 \(\left(M_{w}\right.\) of 192.9 kDa; called PS-M), PS-6 \(\left(M_{w}\right.\) of 1346 kDa; called PS-H), bran, and unfed (St) were randomly selected and euthanized to retrieve the gut tissues. The three PS MPs represented PS polymers with low, medium,

On day 24, the SRs of the respective groups were: PS-1, 93.3 ± 1.2%; PS-2, 89.3 ± 2.3%; PS-3, 91.3 ± 2.3%; PS-4, 94.0 ± 0.0%; PS-5, 92.0 ± 0.0%; PS-6, 86.0 ± 2.0%; bran-fed, 96.0 ± 0.0%; and starvation, 82.7 ± 3.1% (Figure 1b). The mealworms fed with PS-1, PS-2, PS-3, PS-4, and PS-5 had similar high SRs (>-90%), but their SRs were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those of the PS-6 and starvation groups and slightly lower than that of the bran-fed as expected. In this study, cannibalism was observed in the PS-fed and starved mealworms but not in the bran-fed group. Therefore, the lower SRs of the PS-fed and starved mealworms could be partially attributed to innate cannibalistic behavior and malnutrition over time, especially under starvation conditions.

SPCRs were determined after mealworms completely consumed all PS MPs on the basis of the mass of PS MPs ingested per 100 larvae per day. The mealworms in the PS-1 to PS-5 groups completely consumed all of the PS MPs prior to day 24, but the PS-6 group finished the consumption until day 33. After the consumption of all of the PS MPs, the mealworms tried to hide inside the frass layer and ingested the frass as food. The SPCR was relatively high for the mealworms fed with PS-1 to PS-5 MPs (Figure 1c), and a peak rate of 21.5 ± 1.3 mg PS 100 larvae-1 d-1 (or 2.34 ± 0.14 mg PS g larvae-1 d-1) was found in the PS-4 group (Mw of 192.9 kDa). The lowest rate of 12.2 ± 0.2 mg PS 100 larvae-1 d-1 (or 1.33 ± 0.02 mg PS g larvae-1 d-1) was performed by the PS-6 group (Mw of 1346 kDa). The respective SPCR of PS-1, PS-2, PS-3, and PS-5 groups was 17.7 ± 0.5, 19.4 ± 0.5, 19.1 ± 0.9, and 17.7 ± 1.2 mg PS 100 larvae-1 d-1 (Table S5). The results suggested clearly that mealworms exhibited higher affinity for the diets of PS MPs with low (PS-1 and PS-2), medium (PS-3 and PS-4), and high (PS-5) MWs than that with ultrahigh MW (PS-6). However, the reason for the difference in SPCRs among PS-1 to PS-5 was not clear and might be due to other unknown physical factors. In this study, we did find that the ultrahigh MW of PS appeared to influence SPCR negatively, and the low-MW PS to high-MW PS, which basically fits the range of commercial PS foams with broad MWD, was favorable. All SPCRs in this study are basically in line with previous biodegradation studies using commercial PS foams (Mw from 130 to 334 kDa) by mealworms from various sources around the world at 8.5-20.7 mg PS 100 larvae-1 d-1. The SPCRs could be influenced by many factors, including the incubation conditions, properties of the tested PS materials, source of mealworms, mealworm instars and larval size, test temperature, humidity, etc.

Mass Balance and PS Removal. The mass balance and PS removal were estimated on the basis of the mass of ingested PS, the mass of egested frass, and water-, ethanol-, and THF-extracted fractions (Cw, Ce, and Cc). The frass yield, an indirect indicator of digestibility, was 0.60, 0.68, 0.71, 0.62, 0.75, and 0.84 for the mealworms fed with PS-1 to PS-6 MPs, respectively. In general, the PS MPs with the lower MW resulted in the relatively lower frass yield (Figure 1d), suggesting that the lower the MW, the more PS polymers were digested or degraded.

The Cw value indicated the fraction of hydrophilic, digested organic components, and salts in the frass; the Ce value indicated the fraction of lipophilic substances in the frass; and the Cc value indicated the residual and modified PS content in the frass. Therefore, the Cc value was used to estimate residual PS polymers in the frass.

confirmed that all PS MPs tested were depolymerized. The \(M_{w}\) of residual polymers of PS-1, PS-2, PS-3, PS-4, and PS-5 groups significantly decreased by \(10.30 \pm 2.54,8.91 \pm 2.54\), \(9.18 \pm 1.51,19.34 \pm 2.23\), and \(7.50 \pm 1.89 \%\), respectively; \(M_{n}\) declined by \(34.62 \pm 2.01,12.15 \pm 1.37,19.20 \pm 1.86,31.69 \pm\) \(2.38\), and \(23.92 \pm 0.90 \%\), respectively; and \(M_{d}\) reduced by \(4.91\) \(\pm 1.59,6.15 \pm 0.43,3.85 \pm 0.91,6.22 \pm 0.52\), and \(1.95 \pm\) \(1.43 \%\), respectively. These data implied that the PS polymer chains were significantly reduced. The depolymerization fit the typical broad depolymerization (BD) pattern for all PS MPs with low to high MW, which was observed during the biodegradation of commercial PS foams with \(M_{w}\) from 130 to 334 kDa by mealworms in China, the United States, and the United Kingdom. \({ }^{6,7,18,22,25,29}\) Therefore, we conclude that the BD pattern is likely ubiquitous for mealworms to degrade PS polymers with low to high MW (e.g., \(M_{w}<\sim 600 \mathrm{kDa}\) ), although the depolymerization extent was different. We also noticed that the \(M_{d}\) of the high-MW PS polymer (PS-5) only decreased by \(1.95 \pm 1.43 \%\) from 678.0 to 664.8 kDa (Table 1), indicating that the highest-MW portion was indeed challenging for degradation.

For the PS MPs with ultrahigh MW \(\left(M_{w}\right.\) of 1,346 kDa), the shift of MWD of the residual polymers was still toward a low-MW direction (Figure 2a). However, the depolymerization pattern was different and showed limited-extent depolymerization (LD), i.e., the \(M_{w}, M_{n}\), and \(M_{d}\) of the residual PS significantly increased by \(38.93 \pm 3.61,29.10 \pm 2.37\), and \(26.04 \pm 1.34 \%\), respectively (Figure 2b-d). This was also observed in LDPE biodegradation. \({ }^{27}\) The limited-extent depolymerization pattern (the increase in the \(M_{w}, M_{n}\), and \(M_{d}\) ) was likely related to the selective depolymerization and degradation of lower-molecular polymers at higher rates than large molecular portions, i.e., the functional enzymes and gut bacteria in the mealworms efficiently attacked PS polymers with short chains of low and medium MW in nonspecific ways throughout the biodegradation process but reacted slowly with PS polymers with long chains of high and ultrahigh MW. Thus, more portions of high-MW PS polymers remained in the frass, resulting in an increase in \(M_{w}, M_{n}\), and \(M_{d}\), although depolymerization occurred and the broadness of MWD increased (Figure 2a). The observation of limited-extent depolymerization was reported during LDPE degradation in mealworms; \({ }^{22}\) PS degradation in superworms (Z. atratus), \({ }^{30}\) microbial PUR biodegradation by a landfill microbial culture; \({ }^{32}\) and PS degradation in greater waxworms (G. mellonella); \({ }^{34}\) and digestion of PS foam by land snails Achatina fulica. \({ }^{33}\)

The PDI indicated the change of heterogeneity in chainlength distributions of tested polymers. \({ }^{12,20,27,30,31}\) The original PDI of the tested PS ranged from 1.036 to 1.090 (Table 1). After biodegradation, the PDI of all residual PS polymers increased: PS-1 from 1.036 to 1.421, PS-2 from 1.049 to 1.088, PS-3 from 1.051 to 1.181, PS-4 from 1.058 to 1.248, PS-5 from 1.090 to 1.223, and PS-6 from 1.062 to 1.142. The results are consistent with the observations that the MWD of all residual PS polymers shifted (Figure 2a). This suggested the occurrence of endo-type depolymerization or random internal scission of chains in polymer macromolecules, which generated oligomeric products and mid-chain polymers and finally yielded residual polymers with heterogeneous MWD. \({ }^{5,27,43}\)

\section*{Gut Microbial Analysis.} To evaluate the gut microbiome in response to in vivo biodegradation of PS with different MW, we performed gut microbial analysis of the mealworms fed with three selected PS MPs, i.e., low MW (PS-1 with \(M_{w}\) of 6.70 kDa, named PS-L), medium MW (PS-4 with \(M_{w}\) of 192.9 kDa, named PS-M), and ultrahigh MW (PS-6 with \(M_{w}\) of 1346 kDa, named PS-H) vs mealworms fed with bran and unfed. Rarefaction curves suggested that the amplicon quality was guaranteed (Figure S3) with the sequencing information presented in Table S7.

Bacteria belonging to the phylum Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, and Acidobacteriota dominated the gut microbiome in the mealworms (Figure 3a). Firmicutes was the most prevalent phylum in mealworms fed with bran (90.13\%) and PS-L (83.15\%), which was associated with the low MW of both diets. In contrast, the relative abundance of Firmicutes in the PS-M and PS-H groups was as low as 20.13 and 21.84\%, respectively. Meanwhile, the phylum Proteobacteria became dominant in both PS-M and PS-H groups, increasing from 6.63 to 79.77 and 31.85\%, respectively (Figure 3a). The major alteration in the gut microbiome at the family level was mostly associated with Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcaceae, and Spiroplasmataceae after feeding PS polymers with the low and medium MW (Figure 3b). Specifically, the family Streptococcaceae was the most abundant (63.33\%) in the PS-L group, while the family Enterobacteriaceae was the most abundant (79.48\%) in the PS-M group. The remarkable increase in relative abundance of the family Streptococcaceae in the PS-L group was contributed by the genus Lactococcus (Figure 3c) which is a facultative anaerobic fermentative microbe. \({ }^{31,44}\) Previous research found that the Lactococcus genus was strongly associated with PLA degradation, a bio-based biodegradable plastic with low MW and crystallinity. \({ }^{31}\) Future studies are needed to verify the role of this bacterial genus in the biodegradation of low-MW PS. On the other hand, the bacterial family Enterobacteriaceae has been reported to be associated with the depolymerization and biodegradation of various plastics (e.g., PP, PVC, LDPE, and PS) in Tenebrionidae insects, especially commercial PS foams. \({ }^{7,21,23,25,29,32}\) Therefore, the biodegradation of PS-M could be contributed by the family Enterobacteriaceae, which participated in the breaking down and biodegradation of PS and intermediates (Figure 3b).

On the other hand, the gut microbiome of mealworms fed with ultrahigh-MW PS (PS-H) had a more complicated microbial community than those fed with PS-L and PS-M (Figure 3). Gut bacteria with low relative abundance (<1\%) contributed to about 70\% of the community at family level (Figure 3b), suggesting that the biodegradation of ultrahigh-MW PS polymers required complex synergistic microbial consortia. The Shannon index was used to investigate the richness and diversity of the gut microbiome. The Shannon index of the mealworms fed with PS-L and PS-M was at a similar level, which was slightly lower than that of the bran-fed and starved groups, while those fed with PS-H were remarkably higher than all other groups (Figure 3d). The results indicated that the low- and medium-MW PS resulted in gut microbiome of low taxonomic diversity and microbial complexity in the mealworms, while ultrahigh-MW PS caused high taxonomic diversity.

certain amount of carbohydrates, fat, proteins, and vitamins, \({ }^{6,7}\) thus resulting in a relatively complex functional gut micro- biome in bran-fed mealworms.

Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was performed to further compare the gut microbial communities (Figure 3e). Four distinct clusters (bran, PS-L, PS-M, and PS-H) were separated from each other, implying that the gut microbial structure in the respective groups was significantly different. This finding also revealed that the mealworms developed their gut microbiome in response to the biodegradation of the same polymers with different MW. Interestingly, the gut microbial community of the starvation mealworms was also more diversified, i.e., no cluster was developed, which could be attributable to the ingestion of frass, melted skeletons (containing chitin), dead mealworms, and digestion of body biomass (including fats, proteins, etc.) throughout the test period (Figure 3e).

Metabolic Pathway Analysis. Alterations in the metabolomic profiles and metabolic pathways of the mealworms under different diet conditions were analyzed. Compared with the bran-fed mealworms, metabolites in the intestines of mealworms fed with PS-L (Figure 4a), PS-M (Figure 4b), and PS-H (Figure 4c) were all differentially expressed according to the volcano map analysis. Specifically, 90, 190, and 196 differentially expressed metabolites were upregulated in the PS-L, PS-M, and PS-H groups, respectively, while 198, 306, and 221 differently expressed metabolites were downregulated.

These differentially expressed metabolites were screened, and related pathways of the metabolic profiles were analyzed based on topological analysis (TA). The results of the pathway analysis were displayed in bubble diagrams (Figure 4d–f). In general, metabolic pathways were perturbed across the mealworm groups fed with low (PS-L, \(M_{w}\) of 6.70 kDa)-, medium (PS-M, \(M_{w}\) of 192.9 kDa)-, and ultrahigh (PS-H, \(M_{w}\) of 1,346 kDa)-MW PS polymers. Interestingly, riboflavin metabolism, histidine metabolism, and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism were significantly perturbed under all three PS feeding conditions (Figure 4d–f). Riboflavin could provide more electron shuttles and redox mediators that facilitated the extracellular electron transfer. \({ }^{45,46}\) Histidine metabolism was associated with a series of metabolic pathways, including the pentose phosphate pathway, alanine metabolism, and glutamate metabolism. \({ }^{47}\) Therefore, comparative metabolomic analysis implied that innate metabolic mechanisms in the mealworm intestines could coordinate redox capability to complete biodegradation of PS polymers with different MWs synergistically. These findings also revealed that the mealworms might use their endogenous metabolic material reserves to compensate for the lack of nutrients, thus performing PS depolymerization and biodegradation processes.

On the other hand, distinct differential metabolic pathways were observed in the mealworms under different diet conditions. Glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism was significantly perturbed in both groups fed with low (PS-L)- and medium (PS-M)-MW PS polymers (Figure 4d,e), but was less significant in the mealworms fed with ultrahigh (PS-H)- MW PS polymers (Figure 4f). Glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism belong to key energy metabolism pathways \({ }^{41,42,48}\) and might be strongly associated with biodegradation of PS polymers with low and medium MW and metabolism of degradation intermediates with relatively low MW. Starch and sucrose metabolism were also significantly perturbed in the mealworms fed with medium- and ultrahigh-MW PS polymers (Figure 4e,f), but were less significant in the mealworms fed with low-MW PS. This could be attributed to the differences in PS polymer macrostructures and explain the distinctive depolymerization patterns in the guts of mealworms. Further research is needed to verify these perspectives by identifying and investigating the activities of putative PS degrading enzymes and the catalytic mechanisms of these enzymes for PS biodegradation processes.

Several typical metabolic pathways involved in molecular protection and oxidative stress defense (e.g., in zebrafish and mice) have been found significantly altered (Figure 4d–f). For instance, ascorbate and aldarate metabolisms were significantly perturbed in all three mealworm groups, which contributed to maintaining the internal redox balance and defending potential oxidative stress. \({ }^{49}\) Arginine and proline metabolism, which played a role in the maintenance of osmotic equilibrium and the interaction with enzymes to protect the structure of proteins, \({ }^{50}\) were significantly perturbed in the mealworms fed with PS-M and PS-H. Pyrimidine metabolism, an essential metabolic pathway for RNA and DNA synthesis, membrane lipid biosynthesis, and protein glycosylation, \({ }^{51}\) was found to be significantly perturbed only in the mealworms fed with the ultrahigh-MW PS. In addition, linoleic acid metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism, which were associated with membrane integrity repairment and the composition of active substances on the membrane surface, were also observed. \({ }^{41,42}\) Interestingly, these metabolic pathways were more prevalent in the mealworms fed with the ultrahigh-MW PS (Figure 4f). Previous research has indicated that microplastic ingestion could induce possible gut epithelium damage, which led to inflammation and multiple responses of the immune system in various insect species. \({ }^{53}\) We hypothesized that although mealworms were capable of biodegrading PS polymers with various MWs, the uptake of PS MPs still reprogrammed the metabolic pathways within the intestinal environments, resulting in intrinsic metabolic dysbiosis in the mealworms (especially when fed with ultrahigh-MW polymers), including inducing oxidative stress, damaging antioxidant systems and membranes to some extent, as well as impacting the energy supply of mealworms and modulating their growth. Future studies will be needed to verify this hypothesis and understand the complex mechanisms concerning the impacts of MP-induced damage on the PS biodegradation process in mealworms.

Environmental Implications. This work is the first report on the biodegradation of high-purity PS with a variety of defined MWs from low to ultrahigh MW (6.70–1346 kDa) in mealworms (T. molitor larvae) and has confirmed that PS polymers up to 1300 kDa can be depolymerized and biodegraded. The results indicated that the gut microbiome and intestinal metabolic pathways were altered instinctively in response to in vivo biodegradation of PS polymers via different polymerization patterns. Mealworms exhibited distinct affinity, consumption rates, and removal efficiencies depending on the polymer MWs. PS MPs with \(M_{w}\) below 612.2 kDa were degraded via broad depolymerization, while PS MPs with ultrahigh MW were degraded via limited-extent depolymerization. These results indicate that biodegradation of commercial PS products with MW lower than 600 kDa can be performed efficiently, but biodegradation of PS with ultrahigh MWs (e.g., >1000 kDa) is still challenging. According to our previous study, commercial EPS foam contained less than 1% of polymers with MW > 1000 kDa. \({ }^{30}\) Our results suggest that
