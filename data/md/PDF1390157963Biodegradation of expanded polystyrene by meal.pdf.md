## Abstract
The present study investigated the biodegradation of polystyrene (PS) plastic by mealworm larvae (Tenebrio molitor) on different diets followed by untargeted screening of larva gut intestine tissue and frass (manure and feed residuals) to investigate the existence of polymer-generated organic residues. Three different diets, consisting of PS, rolled barley and water were tested. PS degradation rates ranged from 16% to 23% within 15 days, with no statistical differences in survival rates. The larvae fed with ad libitum barley:PS (20:1 w/w) and water had the highest growth rate, while higher PS consumption was observed for barley:PS of 4:1 w/w. A GC-TOF-MS analysis revealed no contaminating substances in the gut intestine tissue, nor styrene or PS oligomers, whilst several bioactive compounds and traces of alkanes, mostly with small carbon chains, were present. Metabolomics analysis on the collected frass, either on the lipophilic (CHCl \(_{3}\) ) or the polar fraction (MeOH-H \(\mathrm{O}_{2}\) ) was performed. Styrene and PS oligomers (dimers, trimers) were identified, though in a relatively low total amount, up to a total of 346.0 ng/mg 2,4 di-tert butylphenol was identified in both frass and tissue, coming from the PS polymer (Non-intentionally added substances; NIAS). Finally, in the polar fraction of frass, bioactive molecules (fatty acids, amides) were identified, together with several hydrocarbons, mostly with longer carbon chains. The formation of these substances indicated enzymatic and biochemical activity in the larva-gut intestine. It was shown that degrading and contaminating organic compounds occur at low levels, in both gut intestine and frass, during biodegradation of PS.

## 1. Introduction
Plastic packaging is associated with raised concerns about the potential harm to the environment and human health. Polystyrene (PS) is a thermoplastic polymer considered the third most important for consumers and industry. It is used extensively to produce food contact materials (FCMs) due to its low cost, durability and mechanical strength (International Life Sciences Institute, 2002). Though possible to recycle mechanically, PS is not presently of great market interest to be used in its recycled form (Ho et al., 2018; International Life Sciences Institute, 2002). Biodegradation is defined by the International Standards Organization (ISO) as the “degradation caused by biological activity, leading to a significant change in the chemical structure of a material” (International Standards Organization (ISO), 2018). During recent years there has been an increasing amount of interest and research conducted on the biodegradation of plastic-based materials promoted by the activity of bacteria and fungi. These organisms are found to be capable of degrading plastics, and together with insects, can convert natural polymers into smaller fragments that facilitate enzymatic reactions (Brandon et al., 2019; Oliveira et al., 2019). Recently, an increasing number of studies have been reported focusing on the bio-recycling of PS

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Chemicals

MSTFA (2,2,2-Trifluoro-N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)-acetamide) containing 1%TMCS (trimethylchloro silane) (Thermo Scientific, USA). Stearic acid-d27 was used as internal standard were obtained from Agilent Technologies (Agilent, USA). Methoxime hydrochloride (98%), chloroform (CHCl3), pyridine and methanol (MeOH) LC-MS grade and 2-propanol (IsOH) LC-MS grade were supplied by Sigma Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany) and Ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ), for the preparation of stock solutions (Millipore, Bedford, USA).

Styrene (≥99%), acetophenone (≥99%) and 1,1-diphenyl-ethylene (97%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany), while the other PS oligomers, namely 2,4,6-triphenyl-1-hexene, 1,3,5-triphenylcyclohexane, 2,4-diphenyl-1-butene, 1,1-diphenyl-ethylene, trans-1,2-diphenycyclobutane, 1a-phenyl-4e-(1-phenylethyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroanaphthalene (1a-tetralin) and 1e-phenyl-4e-(1-phenylethyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-naphthalene (1e-tetralin) were supplied by FUJIFILM Wako Chemicals Europe GmbH (Milano, Italy). Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) 17 mm, 0.2 μm membrane filters were used for filtration of all the samples.

2.2. Test materials and Tenebrio molitor larvae

An expanded PS (EPS) foam packaging (density 0.014 g/cm3) were bought at the local market store. PS material was assessed by attenuated total reflection–Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Recorded spectra and thermograms were evaluated and confirmed the PS nature of the samples (matching FTIR spectra and a glass transition of 100 °C). T. molitor larvae were reared at Aarhus University, Department of Animal Science. Prior to the experiment the diet for the larvae consisted of rolled barley and a mixture of vegetable as a source of water.

2.3. Biodegradation of PS

In addition to the control diet of rolled barley, three experimental setups were compared, as reported in Table 1. In order to assess larvae survival and degradation of PS, 75 larvae (weighting 78 ± 3 mg/larvae) were transferred to 50 cm2 cylindrical plastic containers, given a density of 1.5 larvae/cm2. All experiments were carried out in duplicate, and except for the control, received identical amounts of PS, cut into 2–3 cm cubes (Table 1). They were conducted in a climate controlled room maintained at 25 °C ± 1 °C and 55 ± 5% relative humidity. Mealworm survival rate was assessed by counting dead mealworms every 4 days during a total of 15 days, and dead larvae were then removed from the container. Frass were separated from barley, PS and larvae at the end of each experimental day, by using a 500 μm sieve, and stored at −18 °C until further analysis. In addition to a control of rolled barley, three experimental setups were compared (Table 1), whereas seventy five larvae (weighting 78 ± 3 mg/larvae) were transferred to 50 cm2 cylindrical plastic containers, given a density of 1.5 larvae/cm2.

Diet 1 was based on previous studies (Brandon et al., 2018) and was chosen to ensure comparable results. However, because of the higher portion of unavailable nutrition from the shell of the grain compared to wheat bran, an increased amount of feed was used to avoid starvation of larvae. Water is known to have a large influence on larvae growth (Urs and Hopkins, 1973) and to test the effect of water on PS degradation by larvae, water was added to Diet 2 together with an increased bran:PS (20:1). The latter ratio was implemented as stand-alone diet (no water) to Diet 3, in order to investigate whether larvae were more or less prone to eat PS when more feed was present, together with (or without) the presence of water.

2.4. Analytical methods

2.4.1. GC-based metabolomics

2.4.1.1. Extraction of frass. An amount of 100 mg of frass was placed in an Eppendorf tube and extracted with 500 μL of CHCl3 for 12 h at 25 °C using a vibrational thermostatic mixer. The extract was then filtered with a 0.22 μm PTFE syringe filter and placed into a GC vial and injected. The same amount of frass (100 mg) was extracted following the same procedure but using 500 μL of a MeOH–H2O 1:1 (v/v) mixture. After the extraction, the tubes were centrifuged at 15,000 g for 15 min at 4 °C, after which 200 μL aliquots were transferred to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes. These were then evaporated to dryness using a vacuum centrifuge at 30 °C. The residue was further derivatized using the method reported in paragraph 2.4.2.3.

2.4.1.2. Extraction of gut intestine tissue. Gut intestines were removed from the larvae and homogenized with an electrical homogenizer. An amount of 100 mg was extracted with 500 μL of CHCl3, at 25 °C using an elliptical shaker. Subsequently, the sample was filtered using a 0.22 μm PTFE syringe filter and injected in the GC-TOF-MS system, in triplicates.

| water [ml] | 0 | 0 | 1.5* | 1015 ± 21 | 0 |

* Same amount given at the beginning of the experiment and every fourth day.

A gravimetric method (oven 110 °C for 12 h) was used to derive a humidity of 57.8%. An aliquot of 5 μL of myristic acid-d27 stock solution in H2O:MeOH:isOH; 2:5:2 (v/v/v) was added to the biological extracts. The sample was evaporated to dryness using a vacuum centrifuge at 30 °C. The analysis was performed following the GC-MS metabolomics analytical method at split inlet mode (1:10 split).

2.4.2. Gas chromatography

2.4.2.1. Targeted analysis of monomers and oligomers. The quantification was based on a modified method of the fast GC method reported by Tschatzis et al. using styrene and PS-oligomers standards, that were prepared in CHCl3, and external calibration was applied, according to a previously reported method (Tschatzis et al., 2020b). The organic CHCl3 extracts were filtered with PTFE 0.22 μm filters and a volume 1 μL was injected in the GC-TOF-MS system in split-less mode into an Agilent Technologies 7890B gas chromatography system coupled to an Agilent Technologies 7200 Accurate-Mass Q-ToF mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). Separation of the metabolites was performed on an HP-5MS capillary column coated with polyimide (30 m, 0.250 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness; Agilent Technologies). The temperature of the ion source was 230 °C, the mass spectral analysis was performed in scan mode with a quadruple temperature of 150 °C and a fragmentation voltage of 70 eV, with the remainder settings being kept the same (pressure of 21.4 psi, a gas saver of 20 mL/min and 3 mL/min purge flow). A GC oven programs was applied, where the initial temperature was 60 °C and held for 2 min, followed by a temperature ramp of 10 °C/min up to a temperature of 320 °C, and then held for 5 min. The total analysis time was 34 min.

2.4.2.2. Derivatization. The derivatization protocol was based on the Fiehn GC/MS metabolomics using MSTFA/1% TMCS (Agilent Technologies, 2013) slightly modified. Prior to trimethylsilylation, ketones and aldehydes were protected by derivatization to methoxyamino groups (methoxyamination). An amount of 10 μL of a 40 mg mL-1 solution of methoxyamine hydrochloride in pyridine was added to the frass extract and the mixture was gently shaken at 30 °C for 90 min. Following methoxyamination, N-Methyl-N- trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide with 1% Trimethylchlorosilane (MSTFA/1% TMCS) was added (90 μL) to the methoxyminated samples, for silylation (Agilent Technologies, 2013). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The derivatized samples were cooled to room temperature before transfer to GC vials and injected to the chromatographic system.

2.4.2.3. GC-ToF-MS metabolomics. For GC-based metabolomics, the samples (1 μL aliquot) were injected in split mode (1:10 split ratio) into an Agilent Technologies 7890B gas chromatography system coupled to an Agilent Technologies 7200 Accurate-Mass Q-ToF mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) operating in ToF mode. Separation of the metabolites was performed on an HP-5MS capillary column coated with polyimide (30 m, 0.250 mm i.d., 0258 μm film thickness; Agilent Technologies). The temperatures of the ion source was 230 °C, the mass spectral analysis was performed in scan mode with a quadruple temperature of 150 °C and a fragmentation voltage of 70 eV. Solvent delay was adjusted to 4.5 min. Scanning range was set from m/z 50.0 to m/z 600.0. The TOF-MS conditions were identical as presented in 2.4.2.1.

2.5. Data analysis and statistical analysis

All analytical data was processed with Masshunter 10.0 software (Agilent Technologies, USA), while Mass Profiler Professional (MPP) v.15.0 software (Agilent Technologies, USA) was used as the chemometrics platform for alignment, and exploitation of the received MS data. MPP is the only platform that provides integrated identification/ annotation of compounds and automated sample classification in combination with Masshunter. Pairwise analysis were performed by one-way ANOVA using RStudio (RStudio Team, 2020). On this basis, the identified components in frass fractions (organic; CHCl3, and polar; MeOH:H2O 1:1 v/v) were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) to assess the discrimination between the different feeding strategies, performed with SIMCA 16.0.2 software (Umetrics, Umeå, Sweden).

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Biodegradation of PS

A mass balance on the PS-fed larvae was performed following a gravimetric approach previously reported (Brandon et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2015a). The weights of system inputs (plastic and/or diet containment), and the respective outputs (frass and accumulated larvae weight) were measured. The experimental containers with the mealworm larvae were kept at a constant humidity, and all weights were measured as wet weights, as previously reported (Brandon et al., 2018).

The mass differences originating by the degradation of the PS within the duration of the four experiments were recorded. The mass balance showed that from the initial amounts of PS a significant non-linear degradation rate (p < 0.05) is observed among the different sampling days (Fig. 1A and B), fitting to a polynomial fitting (Fig. 1B). An interesting outcome is that the insects in Diet 2 (high PS:bran, water included) required a significant time to start increasing PS consumption, whilst at the end of the growth period, the PS consumption reached identical levels with Diet 1 (low PS:bran). The addition of water within the diet, improved PS consumption, compared to the absence of water. The total degradation at the end of the experiment (15 days) varied according to the different feeding treatments, from 155 mg (PS/barley 20:1; Diet 3) to 225 mg (PS/barley ad libitum 4:1, Diet 1) corresponding to 15.5%-22.5%. Degradation of PS per gram of larvae increased throughout the experimental period from 0.4 mg PS/g larvae/day to 1.7 mg PS/g larvae/day, after 15 days. This may be due to: the observation period by the larvae before consumption of PS; when the larvae makes tunnels in the PS the surfaces increases which may increase the availability of PS; older and bigger larvae prefer PS over younger and smaller larvae. In all experiments, the PS consumption rate was considered sufficient, and in line with previously reported studies (Brandon et al., 2018, 2021; Tschatzis and Alberto Lopes, 2020; Yang et al., 2021).

At the end of the experiment the survival ratio of the mealworms fed PS was 89.8% ± 4.5%; this ratio was not significantly different (p = 0.90) from the control (89.3% ± 1.9%). No significant difference was also observed between any of the PS treatments. The survival rates were similar to values reported by Brandon et al. (2018) and Yang et al. (2021), for the same period of experimentation and feed (PS).

Regarding average weight gain during the experiment, the larvae grew from an average weight of 78 ± 3 mg/larvae to 116 ± 7 mg/larvae. ANOVA revealed that the larvae provided with water (Diet 2) grew more than larvae in the three other treatments including the control (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2). The average weight gain of larvae provided with water in the 15 day experimental period was 46 ± 2.1 mg/larvae (Fig. 2A), compared to the 35 ± 1.3 mg/larvae (Fig. 2B) for the other treatments. Diet only showed an effect on growth which indicate that all diets tested can be used for experiments like the present. Diet 3 requires the least handling but if the experimental period is longer than the 15

\section*{Untargeted screening of organic content in insects tissue and frass}

Apart from the degrading polymer, a screening of the organic content of both the frass and the tissue of larvae was performed. No post-degradation was applied (i.e. lyophilisation) in the case of larvae gut intestine tissue analysis, as reported in a previous study (Tschatzis and Alberto Lopes, 2020).

Unlike the frass extraction procedure, the intact gut intestine larvae was extracted, in order to see what was accumulated in terms of organic compounds coming from the polymer. Hence, the potential losses of certain volatiles (i.e. alkanes) or semi-volatile compounds (i.e. esters) was avoided. In both cases (frass and larvae gut intestine tissue) an extraction with \(\mathrm{CHCl}_{3}\) was performed to obtain the lipophilic fraction. The selection of a chlorinated solvent was based on previous studies, where its efficiency in extracting food contact materials (FCM) substances has been demonstrated (Tschatzis et al., 2020a, 2020b). In this work \(\mathrm{CHCl}_{3}\) was chosen over dichloromethane to also facilitate the extraction of organic components, such as fatty acids and amides (Tschatzis and Alberto Lopes, 2020).

\subsection*{3.2.1. Analysis of frass}

Lou et al. analyzed the frass collected after the biodegradation of PS, where they identified a limited number of PS-oligomers and PS generated compounds (NIAS). Herein, the frass extracted with \(\mathrm{CHCl}_{3}\) also revealed the presence of several organic polymer-related compounds in relatively low amounts (Tschatzis and Alberto Lopes, 2020). Therefore, the following compounds have been detected and quantified, using a validated analytical method (Tschatzis et al., 2020b): acetophenone, styrene, 2,4,6-triphenyl-1-hexene, 1,3,5-triphenylcyclohexane, 2, 4-diphenyl-1-butene, 1,1-diphenyl-ethylene, trans-1,2-diphenycyclobutane, 1a-phenyl-4e-(1-phenylethyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (1a-tetralin) and 1e-phenyl-4e-(1-phenylethyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphtha-lene (1e-tetralin) (Fig. 3).

Some of these compounds were not detected in a previous study, which included a lyophilisation step that may contributed to the loss of these volatile (Tschatzis and Alberto Lopes, 2020). Furthermore, 2, 4-DTBP was detected in the different commercial PS-material used. This NIAS compound originates from the degradation of Irgafos 168 (FCM 671; tris (2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphate), which is a typical antioxidant additive (European Commission, 2011), for which no-observed adverse-effect levels (NOAEL) has been observed in rats. The identification and quantification of 2,4-DTBP and Irgafos 168 is common when analysing FCM materials (Tschatzis and Alberto Lopes, 2020; Tschatzis et al., 2020a, 2020c). A GC chromatogram of the analysis of \(\mathrm{CHCl}_{3}\) extract from frass is provided in the supplementary material (Fig. S1).

Higher content of monomer and oligomers was observed when larvae were fed with PS, especially in case of the barley consumption (Diet 1), we had a higher amount of degrading compounds (Fig. 3). This can be explained by the higher consumption of PS (Fig. 1), while in case

(hexadecanoic, octadecanoic, tetradecanoic acid), amides (oleamide, tetradecanamide, hexadecanamide), cholesterol. All these metabolites are indicating the existing enzymatic activity, which is higher (Fig. 4, Fig. S2; PCA biplots) in case of Diet 1, while cholesterol is higher for increased bran:PS (Diets 2 and 3). Diet 1 facilitates the increase of primary amides, while Diets 2 and 3 elaborated the excretion of fatty acids, probably due to biosynthesis. A comparison of the generated metabolites among the applied diets was performed, in order to identify and explore the potential effect of the PS ratio and the water during the metabolism process of mealworm with PS-containing diets.

The variation of glycerol may indicate that mealworms were under metabolic stress. Glycerol is synthesis precursor of triacylglycerols (TAG) and phospholipids, that an organism can use to store amounts of energy (Arrese and Soulages, 2010). However, enzymatic hydrolysis of TAG and phospholipids can occur, in case of reduced amount of available food or stress, like in case of the PS-fed larvae. Enzymatic reactions can be justified from the increase of excreted glycerol in frass (Table 3) and in combination with the formation of fatty acid content stored in gut intestine tissue (Table 4). The latter also supports the existence of enzymatic reactions within larvae' gut intestine. Moreover, it has been already reported, that TAG can be hydrolysed (by enzymes) in the intestine to free fatty acids (Pan and Hussain, 2012) and glycerol by adipose triglyceride lipase (AGTL) (Zechner et al., 2005).

In addition, in case of the polar fraction, PCA analysis without the control, in order to remove the main cause of variance of PC1, did not highlight any differences among the components of the variance (Fig. S3). Moreover, univariate analysis among the diets revealed a statistical significant decrease only for mannose (1.way ANOVA). Thus, among the three studied diets we observed only a decrease in mannose. Mannose is an important monosaccharide for protein glycosylation in mammals and is considered an non-efficient cellular energy source. Mannose is an abundant monosaccharide in N-linked glycosylation, which is a post-translational modification of proteins. Glycosylation is an important and highly regulated mechanism of secondary protein synthesis within cells (Sharma et al., 2014, 2018). The latter, can also be correlated with the observed enzymatic activity that resulted in higher PS degradation rates (Fig. 1). Finally, it cannot be underestimated that mannose can be converted into glucose, via glycans biosynthesis, during catabolism that can justify also the higher survival rates, which is highly associated with the increased enzymatic activity taking place, during PS biodegradation (Reily et al., 2019; Sharma et al., 2014). Regarding the polar fraction of the frass, we identified that glycosylation and fatty acid metabolism are the main metabolic pathways involved.

\subsection*{3.2.2. Analysis of polar fraction of frass}

PCA was performed (Fig. 5), where it can be seen that for the identified compounds, the samples are clustered in two distinct regions in the PCA score plot (R2X1 = 78.0\%; R2X2 = 12.3\%) according to the feeding strategies. This indicates that the frass content/profile of the control diet larvae differs from those of the other three diets, while their polar fraction do not differ significantly with the different feeding of the insects. Thus, all PS-fed treated insects did not show differentiation among their polar fraction (metabolites) (Fig. 5).

The majority of the metabolites observed to significantly down-regulate (p < 0.05) from the control to the PS-fed insects, while three of them upregulated (Table 3). Among them, ethylbis(trimethylsilyl) amine, a silyl derivative of \(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\), that may be excreted by the insects. Similarly to what was observed in Table 2, the oleic acid content increased in the frass of the PS-fed mealworms, probably due to lipid metabolism (Arrese and Soulages, 2010) A GC chromatogram of the analysis of \(\mathrm{CHCl}_{3}\) extract from frass is provided in the supplementary material (Fig. S4).

The analysis of the biomass revealed no residues of any PS monomers or oligomers (Tschatzis et al., 2020b), nor other regulated compounds and non-regulated (NIAS), coming from the polymer. However, several biologically active compounds have been identified, among several alkanes or bioactive components (acids, vitamins and amides), as presented in Table 4.

The identification of the compounds is in agreement with previously studies in biomass, although in this case samples were lyophilized (Tschatzis and Alberto Lopes, 2020). Since the gut intestine samples were not lyophilized, a larger number of compounds were identified (Table 4). All identified compounds were bioactive substances (i.e. acids, amides, ester, squalene, and cholesterol) and no detectable accumulation of FCM substances was observed (i.e. monomers, oligomers). These volatile compounds may have been excreted by the insects, resulting in low mass fractions detected (Tschatzis et al., 2020b). A typical GC chromatogram is provided in supplementary material (Fig. S5).

Similar observations were reported by Brandon et al. for mealworms fed with accumulating flame retardants, indicating a capability of larvae to excrete organic compounds from their body. A recent work from Brandon et al. reported that a typical flame retardant (hexabromocyclododecane, HBCD) consumed by the mealworms was excreted via the frass within \(24 \mathrm{~h}\), with very low amounts of the ingested HBCD being retained in the mealworm body tissue. Hence, it can be concluded that highly toxic and lipophilic compounds, may not be retained or accumulated in the mealworms after PS biodegradation (Brandon et al., 2019).

\section*{4. Conclusions}

This work presents an in-depth study of the generated, formed and potentially accumulated organic compounds, and polymer-based chemical substances, during biodegradation of PS with insects' larvae. A study of the biodegradation of PS with mealworms larvae was performed, applying different feeding diets, which did not have an effect on the degradation of PS and on the survival rate of PS-fed larvae. The untargeted screening of the larvae revealed no presences of plastic polymer-generated compounds (monomers, oligomers, NIAS), indicating no bioaccumulation. Several of these compounds were identified and quantified in the frass, but at a very low content (mass fraction). In the case of frass, a GC-TOF-MS metabolomics study has been performed, in which the lipophilic and polar fraction were analyzed. It was identified that several bioactive compounds, such as long chain fatty acids, esters and amides, were generated, and probably related to the enzymatic activity taking place in their gut intestine, during bio-degradation of the plastic. The latter is also suggested by the fact that several long chain acids, besides hydrocarbons, were present due to the degradation of the PS. Finally, in all studied diets, together with the consumption of PS, the insects were undergo through metabolic stress, due to the consumption of plastic, in comparison to their typical diet.
