### Abstract

The present study reports the biodegradation of polystyrene (PS) by mealworm (Tenebrio molitor) following different feeding regimes. Changes in lipids and protein were studied to evaluate possible differences in the growth and metabolic pathways of the insects depending on the diets. Thermo-gravimetric analysis of the excretions (frass) revealed a decrease in the molecular mass of the PS polymers. The insects' biomass contained less protein when PS was part of the diet, suggesting that the insects undergo a certain level of stress compared to control diets. The frass also contained lower amount of nitrogen content compared to that from insects fed a control diet. \(\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}\)and other cations involved in biochemical processes were also measured in insects' frass, including potassium, sodium, magnesium, and calcium, combined with a small pH change. The decrease in the mineral content of the frass was attributed to increased cellular activity in PS-fed insects. A higher amount of ceramides and cardiolipins, biomarkers of apoptosis, were also found in association with PS consumption. It was concluded that the insects could metabolize PS, but this caused an increase in its stress levels.

# Introduction

Polystyrene (PS) is a polymer extensively used in the production of food contact material (FCM) packaging due to its low cost, durability and mechanical properties (ILSI, 2002). However, plastic packaging is associated with negative effects on the environment (Tschatzis et al., 2020b). Plastic recycling, bio-recycling and biodegradation are critical to achieve a more sustainable, responsible and green society, and efforts are undergoing to ensure a net zero environmental impact by 2030, as defined by the European Commission and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) (European Commission, 2019a, 2019b; Ojha et al., 2020; Stroka et al., 2021).

PS is a polymer that is difficult to decompose, it presents a low recycling rate, and can result in potential accumulation in the environment in the form of microplastics. There is currently an increasing interest in the biodegradation of plastics, and using microbial ecosystems, based on their potential enzymatic activities, which have shown to be able to degrade plastic materials (Przemieniecki et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2018b). Several studies have already reported the ability to degrade PS by insects such as mealworms (Tenebrio molitor) (Tschatzis et al., 2020, 2021; Yang et al., 2015a, 2015b, 2018b), superworms (Zophobas morio) (Yang et al., 2020), waxworms (Galleria mellonella) (Lou et al., 2020) and Tenebrio obscurus (Peng et al., 2019). It has been recently demonstrated that their gut microbiome contributes to plastic biodegradation (Brandon et al., 2021). In the gut, there are some dominant microbial species and a high variety of enzymatic activities, including phosphatases, esterases, leucine ary lamidase, β-galactosidase, β-glucuronidase, α-glucosidase, β-glucosidase, chitinase, α-mannosidase and α-fucosidase (Przemieniecki et al., 2020; Stoops et al., 2016).

It has been shown previously that during plastic biodegradation there is an increased formation and accumulation of long chain free fatty acids (FFAs) in the insects' biomass (Lou et al., 2020; Tschatzis et al., 2020). The generation of these FFAs was attributed to both enzymatic degradation as well as increased metabolic processes of the intestinal microbiota in waxworms (Lou et al., 2020) and mealworms (Tschatzis et al., 2020, 2021). The presence of amides has also been reported, in relation to the increase in enzymatic activity and bio-catalytic amide bond formation (Tschatzis et al., 2020), as a result of the enzymatic activation of amino acids followed by nucleophilic substitution by general amines using a tyrocidine synthetase from Escherichia coli (Hara et al., 2018). Further, a recent gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) metabolomics study revealed several bioactive molecules (FFA, amides), coexisting with several hydrocarbons, mostly with longer carbon chains, once again supporting the increased enzymatic and biochemical activity in the larvae intestine during plastic biodegradation (Tschatzis et al., 2020, 2021).

It is known that different feeding supplementation strategies, including the addition of barley bran and hydration, affect mealworms' growth rate and PS consumption yields, while contributing to the insects' survival and growth (Lou et al., 2021; Tschatzis et al., 2021). These studies revealed no significant amounts of hydrolysed PS in the insects' intestinal tissue suggesting that the breakdown of PS occurs by enzymatic degradation to styrene monomers or oligomers, thus highlighting the potential of this approach for PS biodegradation (Lou et al., 2020; Tschatzis et al., 2021). By the same token, several bioactive compounds and traces of alkanes, mostly small carbon chains, were identified during biodegradation. Furthermore, a variation in the levels of glycerol and fatty acids led to the hypothesis that the mealworms undergo significant metabolic stress, mostly due to the reduced amount of available nutrients in PS rich diets (Tschatzis et al., 2020, 2021). It is therefore necessary to carry out further studies to better understand the effect of different PS-containing diets on the biochemical processes occurring during PS biodegradation.

The scope of this work was to further understand the mechanisms underpinning PS biodegradation by assessing differences in larva lipids (lipidomics) and protein biomass alterations that could be correlated with cell activity. The latter will underpin and confirm existing differences in larva growth and metabolic pathways, depending on the different studied diets. Thus, the presence of cellular and membrane lipids, linked to important biochemical pathways, was evaluated, and the key compounds identified. Furthermore, biomarkers of insects' well-being were assessed and related to the biodegradation of PS, to identify efficient strategies that may lead to an improvement of this process. To the best of our knowledge, no research exists, highlighting the cell alteration of cellular lipids and protein in mealworms.

\section*{2. Materials and methods}

\subsection*{2.1. Chemicals}

LC-MS grade methanol, acetonitrile, isopropanol, methyl tert- butyl ether (MTBE) and tetrahydrofuran (THF; anhydrous, \(\geq 99.9 \%\) ) were purchased from Merck (Steinheim, Germany). For the NMR experiments, chloroform-d (99.8\%) and tetramethylsilane (TMS) to lock the signals were provided by Sigma Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany), while the certified qNMR standard Dimethyl sulfone-DMSO \({ }_{2}\) (TraceCERT) was supplied by Sigma Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). Ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ) was produced using a millipore system (Millipore, Bedford, USA). LC MS grade acetic acid, formic acid, ammonium formate and ammonium acetate were purchased from Sigma- Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). For protein and nitrogen analysis, Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA; 99.9\%) and tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (THAM) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany).

\subsection*{2.2. Polystyrene and biodegradation with Tenebrio molitor larvae}

Expanded PS (EPS) foam packaging (density \(0.014 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}\) ) was purchased at the local store and was assessed by attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to confirm the nature of the material (matching FTIR spectra and a glass transition of \(109{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\), confirmed with standards). The PS studied, based on the producer's information, had a number-average molecular weight \(\left(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{n}}\right)\) of approximately 100000 and weight-average molecular weight \(\left(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{w}}\right)\) of 220000, which represents the most common type of PS on the market.

\(T\). molitor larvae were reared at Aarhus University, Department of Animal Science where they were fed a diet consisting of a mixture of rolled barley (bran) together with vegetable waste and water. The composition of the bran was: 22\% starch, 2.8\% soluble fibre, 43.2\% insoluble fibre, 14.7\% protein, 4.5\% fat and 5.6\% ash.

In addition to a control diet consisting of 100\% bran, three additional dietary regimes were compared to assess the effect of the supplementation of PS in the mealworm' diet. Diet 1 consisted of an addition of PS to bran at a bran:PS ratio of 4:1 w/w (Diet 1), while the other two diets contained a bran:PS ratio of 20:1 (w/w), with (Diet 2) or without (Diet 3) \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\) every fourth day. The latter aimed to assess whether larvae were prone to metabolize PS with hydration.

The

2.3. Moisture, ash and nitrogen/protein in frass and biomass

The moisture content was measured gravimetrically, according to the official AOAC method (Association of Official Analytical Chemists, 1990) for the insects and frass, to identify any potential differences due to the different diets. In brief, a portion of 300 mg was weighted in pre-weighted metal racks which were then placed in an oven for 6 h at 100 ± 0.5 °C. The crude protein content was determined using a DumaTherm Nitrogen/Protein analyzer (C. Gerhardt GmbH & Co. KG, Königswinter, Germany) with a protein-to-nitrogen conversion factor of 6.25, in the case of mealworms. The N2 content calibration was performed with EDTA and THAM. The combustion reactor was operated at 979 °C, the reduction reactor at 649 °C and the degassing oven at 299 °C. Data were analyzed using the DumaTherm Manager v4.17 (Gerhardt, Germany) software. All experiments were performed in duplicate for each diet, on both the worm and frass fractions.

2.4. Ion chromatography for free cations in the frass

For the ion chromatography analysis an aliquot of 100 mg of frass was dissolved in 1 mL of ultrapure H2O, centrifuged at 14000 g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected for cation analysis. A 1:100 dilution of the samples was performed and filtered through a 0.22 μm nylon filter prior to injection in the ion chromatographic system. For the analysis of cations, was performed and filtered through a 0.22 μm nylon filter prior to injection in the ion chromatographic system. For the analysis of cations, a Dionex ICS-6000 ion chromatographic system (Thermo Scientific, USA), equipped with a gradient pump module, with a high-pressure injection valve and a 10-μL sample loop and conductivity detector was used. Data collection was controlled by the Chromeleon 7 software. For the cations, the Dionex Ionpac CS12A analytical column (250 × 2 mm I.D.) and CG12 A-8 μm guard column (50 × 2 mm I.D.) were used with a Cation Dynamically Regenerated Suppressor (Dionex CDRS 600 2 mm). A 10 μL aliquot of sample was injected and eluted at a flowrate of 0.25 mL min−1, at a temperature of 25 °C for 15 min. The eluent was mixed with 20 mL methanesulfonic acid, and all the samples were prepared and analyzed in duplicate. Lithium, sodium, ammonium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium were determined and quantified using a set of commercial standards (Dionex Six Cation-I standard) prepared at different concentrations and eluted under the same conditions as above detailed. Of note is the fact that lithium was not detected in any of the analyzed frass samples.

2.5. Thermo-gravimetric analysis

A thermo-gravimetric analysis instrument (TGA-2 STAR system, Mettler Toledo, USA), equipped with STAR software, was used to detect thermal changes in the residual PS polymer in mealworm frass. An aliquot of 5.5-6.0 mg of bran and frass samples and 2.5 mg of PS powder was loaded in Mettler Toledo aluminum crucibles with punctured lids and heated from ambient temperature to 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under a high-purity nitrogen environment. Because of the foamy nature of PS, it was not possible to load equal amounts of it into the aluminum crucibles. To estimate the degradation of PS a preliminary derivative analysis was carried out to calculate the peak temperature and area at which thermal melting of the PS occurred.

2.6. Lipidome

2.6.1. Lipid extraction from tissue samples

The extraction protocol followed the same method as reported for the organic extraction of tissue samples (Vorkas et al., 2018). Briefly, aliquots (75 mg, with a 5% maximum variation) of wet tissue were mixed with the extraction solvent, consisting of methanol/methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) 1:3 v/v, and loaded in bead beating tubes together with the weighed tissue and/or bead. The samples were treated into a tissuelyzer system, where they were homogenized using a vibration sequence at 6500 Hz for 40 s. The tubes were then centrifuged at 20,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C and the organic solvent phase was divided in three aliquots of 400 μL each. A pooled sample was prepared by pooling the remaining tissue extracts and decanting an equal volume (25 μL) from each bead-beating tube. The solvent was then evaporated using a vacuum concentrator, at 30 °C, for 2 h. All samples were reconstituted using a solvent mixture of water/acetonitrile (ACN)/isopropanol (IPA) 1:1:3 v/v/v (Pham et al., 2019; Vorkas et al., 2018).

2.6.2. UHPLC conditions

The extracted larvae's tissue (section 2.6.1) was analyzed by a UHPLC system (Agilent 1290) coupled to a quadrupole Time-Of-Flight (TOF) mass spectrometer (Agilent 6540 UHD Accurate-Mass, Agilent, Germany). The analytical column was a Luna C18 100 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm particle size (Phenomenex, USA). The mobile phase consisted of solvent A (acetonitrile: H2O 60:40 v/v) containing 10 mM ammonium formate and solvent B consisting of isopropanol: acetonitrile:water 90:10:1 v/v/v. Both phases A and B contained 0.1% formic acid. The gradient program changed linearly from 50% to 95% B in 25 min followed by an isocratic elution for 4 min. An equilibration time of 1 min was set for the mobile phase (Vorkas et al., 2018). The column was maintained at 55.0 °C with a column oven while the autosampler was kept at 8.0 °C. The injection was set with a partial loop, with needle overfill option and overfill flush of 4 μL. The sample injection volume was 5 μL for positive polarity and 10 μL for negative polarity mode (Vorkas et al., 2018). The following system gradient was used for separating the lipid classes and molecular species (Pham et al., 2019): with a flow rate of 0.2 mL min−1. The run started with 30% solvent B for 3 min, followed by 43% for 5 min, then to 50% for 1 min, to 90% for 9 min and finally to 99% for 8 min. The final step was (99% B) was kept isocratic for 4 min. The column was re-equilibrated to the starting conditions (70% solvent A) for 5 min prior to each new injection.

2.6.3. High resolution mass spectrometry

Combined with the UHPLC system (section 2.6.2) a high-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (QTOF) was used. Hence, dual electron spray ionization (ESI), operating in positive ionization mode, with a 4 kV capillary voltage was used. The source was kept at 325 °C, with nitrogen gas used for both drying (40 psi) and nebulizing (with a flow rate of 10 L min−1). The fragmentor, the skimmer and the octapole 1 RF Vpp were set at 170 V, 65 V and 750 V, respectively. The acquisition mode of the TOF-MS was full scan MS mode and was set to acquire data over an m/z range of 100–1600 Da at a rate 3 spectra/s.

The system had the possibility of carrying out MS² analysis, or, as called in Agilent products, "all ion MS-MS". This technique is useful when screening is needed, as the precursor and product ions of an analyte are simultaneously acquired in a single run, in what is generally considered a data-independent acquisition mode. For these experiments, three scan segments were set in MS mode, alternating the collision energies between 5 and 60 eV. Alternating the collision energies allowed us to acquire simultaneously the precursor ion (segment one) and

\subsection{2.7. \({ }^{1} \mathrm{H}\) NMR analysis}

\subsubsection{2.7.1. Extraction and analysis of PS from frass}

A solid liquid extraction protocol was applied, following a slightly modified method for the extraction of PS from frass (Wu and Criddle, 2021). Briefly, an amount of 50.0 mg (±0.01 mg) of frass or 20.0 mg (±0.01 mg) of PS material, was weighed in a glass vial, where a volume of 2.0 mL of THF was added. The vial was closed and heated to 55 \({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) for 2 h Then the resulting extracts were filtered through 0.45 \(\mu \mathrm{m}\) PVDF filter and transferred to a clean 10-mL glass vial. The extract was evaporated to dryness under nitrogen and subsequently reconstituted in 2 mL CDCl \(_{3}\) for the NMR analysis. Approximately 600 \(\mu \mathrm{L}\) of this solution was then transferred to a 5 mm NMR sample tube (Wilmad, LabGlass, Vineland, NJ, USA). The extractions of PS were done in duplicate and all samples were weighed on a Mettler Toledo (Columbus, OH, USA) digital balance with a ±0.01 mg (manufacturer's stated) uncertainty.

\subsubsection{2.7.2. Instrumental conditions}

To confirm the changes in the PS molecular structure, the extracted PS from the mealworm frass were characterized by mono-dimensional \({ }^{1} \mathrm{H}\) NMR experiments using Zg30 Bruker experiment sequences. The experiments were performed on a Bruker Avance 600 (nominal frequency 600.13 MHz) (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany) equipped with a 5 mm cryo-probe. The spectra were recorded at 298 K using a 90 \({ }^{\circ}\) flip angle, an acquisition time of 8 min 49 s (64k data points) and a total recycling time of 5.0 s. A spectral width of 16 ppm with 64 scans and no sample rotation in the DQD acquisition mode were applied. Prior to Fourier transformation, a 0.5 Hz line-broadening factor was applied, and all spectra were phase- and baseline-corrected using the Bruker Topspin 3.2 software. Chemical shifts ($\delta$) for \({ }^{1} \mathrm{H}\) NMR spectra are reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to the TMS internal standard.

\subsection*{2.8. Statistical, multivariate and data analysis}

All analytical data was processed with Masshunter 10.0 software (Agilent Technologies, USA), while Mass Profiler Professional (MPP) v.15.0 software (Agilent Technologies, USA) was used as the chemometrics platform for alignment and exploitation of the received MS data. MPP is the only platform that provides integrated identification/ annotation of compounds and automated sample classification in combination with Masshunter. Agilent MassHunter Lipid Annotator software (Agilent, USA) was used for rapid and accurate lipid annotations.

A multivariate statistical analysis was performed using Simca-P v17.0.2 software (UMETRICS AB Sweden). Principal component analysis (PCA) and Orthogonal Partial Least Squared Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) was used for modelling the differences between the metabolic profile of control insect samples and the different feeding conditions and for the statistical evaluation of the models. To increase the reliability of the models R2Y (cum) and Q2 (cum) approach was applied [R2Y (cum):total sum of variation in Y explained by the model and Q2 (cum): goodness of prediction]. Variable Importance for Prediction (VIP) scores also were calculated from OPLS-DA models. Only variables with scores >1 and without negative confidence intervals were selected as most significant. Statistical analysis of replicate samples was performed using Microsoft Excel, and further statistical analysis, such as one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey comparison tests in all cases, were performed with Minitab 18.0 statistical software (Minitab Inc., State College, PA, USA), to establish and confirm the significance of important variables.

\section*{3. Results and discussions}

\subsection*{3.1. Insect growth and biomass composition}

In a parallel study (Tschatzis et al., 2021), it was reported that the kinetics of degradation of PS (PS/g larvae) increased throughout the experimental period, from 0.4 mg PS/g larvae/day to 1.7 mg PS/g larvae/day, after 15 days. The diet containing additional \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\), showed an initial lag phase (Tschatzis et al., 2021). A lower bran:PS ratio provided relatively higher consumption, which was tentatively explained by the


No overall differences were noted in this experiment, compared to other comparable studies (Brandon et al., 2018a; Yang et al., 2021) (Fig. S1), and in the present study, no cannibalism was observed during the established experimental period (Table S1). For larvae average weight, Diet 3 showed the highest statistically significant value, followed by Diet 2, and then Diet 1. Only for Diet 2 and 3 the average larvae weight was higher than for the control diet.

Fig. 1 shows the water and protein/nitrogen content of the larval biomass and the moisture content of the excreted frass. The goal was to identify any differences between the different diets and in particular any effects due to hydration. Control and Diet 1 had the highest moisture content, compared to the other two diets, even if in Diet 2 additional H2O was provided to the insects. This result supported our hypothesis of a modified metabolic and biochemical activity in PS diets. In case of the frass, the results indicated no statistical difference between any of the treatments (control vs PS containing diets). Thus, the moisture content of the larval biomass was not statistically different between diets, ranging from 63% (±0.8%) for control diet to 64% (±0.6%) for Diet 1. The moisture content of the frass ranged from 8.5% (±0.12%) for control samples to 7.1% (±0.11%) for Diet 3 (Fig. 1).

An ANOVA statistical analysis (Table S1) denoted differences between the different feeding experiments for PS degradation in relation to the Control diet, revealing that Diet 2 (the only one with water added) was always statistically different from the other 2 diets (Diet 1 and 3) and the control. More specifically, Diet 2 presented the lowest nitrogen frass content (14.4% dry basis), the lowest protein content (44.9% dry basis) and an intermediate water content of the larvae biomass (Table S1). Nevertheless, in all experiments the moisture content of the frass (%) proved not to be statistically significant.

There was a clear effect of PS consumption on the protein content in the insects' biomass as well to the amount of nitrogen excreted in their frass. It was expected that, with the increase in insects' growth, there would be an increase in the protein biomass, rather than a decrease. However, the obtained results showed a different behavior. In the insect population fed a control diet, the biomass protein content was 59.4% (dry basis), in accordance with previously reported results (Kourimská and Adámková, 2016; Zhao et al., 2016). Conversely, a decrease was

| PS | – | 417 ± 0 | – |
| Bran | 303 ± 0 | – | – |
| Control | 288 ± 2 | – | – |
| Diet 1: bran:PS (4:1) m/m | 287 ± 4 | 428 ± 1 | 1.58 |
| Diet 2: bran:PS (20:1 m/m): H₂O | 291 ± 2 | 428 ± 1 | 1.05 |
| Diet 3: bran:PS (20:1 m/m) | 288 ± 1 | 428 ± 2 | 2.03 |

Values are expressed as average with standard deviations (n = 3).

The observed changes in metabolites (cations) concentration might be due to a potential bran dilution in the diet; however, it may be possible to consider that, if any diet dilution occurred, then there should be a lower cation content for Diet 3 than Diet 1, as they differed in the bran:PS ratio. However, this was not the case. Furthermore, Diet 2, with the same bran:PS ratio as Diet 3, showed a decrease in cations compared to the other diets (of note that the values are reported on a dry basis).

The mineral content present in the insects fed the control diet was similar to what was reported for mealworm larvae in the literature. As with vitamins and other essential food nutrients, mineral requirements vary between animal species (Ryan, 1991; Soetan et al., 2010). Magnesium (Mg²⁺) is an essential mineral used as a cofactor of several biochemical activities, such as cellular energy production processes. Yamanaka et al. (2016) reported that a disfunctional Mg²⁺ homeostasis is involved in various cellular malfunctions, especially in relation to those reactions where mitochondria, the energy-producing organelles are involved. Indeed, mitochondria are major intracellular Mg²⁺ reservoirs, as this ion regulates coupled reactions in energy metabolism, i.e. the TCA cycle, the electron transport chain and ADP/ATP translocation (Yamanaka et al., 2016). Therefore, nutritional stress can alter the mitochondrial Mg²⁺ concentration, ultimately affecting cellular energy metabolism (Yamanaka et al., 2016). Therefore, the observed reduction in Mg²⁺ ions in the excreted frass of insects, may be a sign of the nutritional stress posed to the insects, when PS is present in their diets.

In the case of Na⁺ and K⁺, in insects, the V-ATPase and the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase play dominant roles in osmo-regulation and excretion. Furthermore, the branchial Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase is stimulated synergistically by NH₄⁺ and K⁺ and is involved in transport of ammonia from the hemolymph into the cytoplasm via the basolateral Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase (Weihrauch and O'Donnell, 2015). The differences in Na⁺ and K⁺ observed in this work, together with the changes in Mg²⁺, may then suggest an enhanced mitochondrial activity in the insects, stimulated by the self-regulating process (homeostasis) induced by the nutritional stress.

\subsection*{3.3. Thermo-gravimetric analysis of the frass}

A recent study demonstrated no accumulation of PS monomers or oligomers in the biomass of the insects exposed to similar dietary conditions (Tschatzis et al., 2021). This work extended the knowledge to the determination and identification of the excretion metabolites of PS in the insects' frass. To evaluate the presence of PS in the frass, TGA analysis was carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere. The analysis of the frass of the mealworms fed the different PS diets was carried out by heating the samples from 40 to \(600{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\). The obtained curves are reported in the supplementary material (Fig. S3). Table 1 summarizes the peak temperature for the two thermal transitions for bran and PS as well as the peak area for the PS peak. Any difference in the thermo-gravimetry curve may indicate differences in the physical and chemical structure of the polymers present in the samples (i.e. molecular weight changes).

The thermograms, and, more clearly, the first derivative peaks, indicated three stages during heating. A first peak (at \(\sim 85-90^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\)), identified in all samples but for PS, was caused by water and other volatiles losses. A 2nd transition was clearly identified between 287 and \(303^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) and was attributed to the bran fraction. Thermal degradation of carbohydrates and proteins occurred over a broad range of temperatures (Chen et al., 2018), depending on their composition and nature, and in this case as seen by the bran sample, the main transition was noted at 287 to \(303^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\). Clearly, this transition peak was hardly visible in the pure PS sample. The third transition, occurring at high temperature, was related to PS decomposition, as clearly demonstrated by the PS control sample. There was a shift in the temperature of transition of PS in the frass samples compared to the neat PS, from a degradation temperature of \(417^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) (for the neat PS) to \(428^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\), regardless of feeding regimes. The area of the peak was also the smallest for Diet 2 while the highest for Diet 3. The thermal stability of the polymer blends depends on the nature of the polymer components in the blends. The characteristic temperatures for PS, as reported in the literature are \(401^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(\mathrm{T}_{50}\right), 440^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(\mathrm{T}_{100}\right)\) and \(403.3^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{p}}\right)\), with a melting point of \(412.3^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{m}}\right)\) (Farha et al., 2020). The shift to higher transition temperatures is related to a decrease in the molecular mass of the polymer ((Kokta et al., 1973; Nishizaki, 1981). This is also the case for other similar polymers like poly (a-methyl styrene) (Ye et al., 2015).

The data clearly demonstrated that although PS was still present in the insects' excreted frass, there were differences between the PS molecular mass for the different diets. The PS peak in Diet 1, 2 and 3 did not show significant differences in relation to the peak temperature. The diet with high bran-to-PS ratio and the presence of water (Diet 2; bran:PS 20:1+H2O) degraded more polymer compared to the other two diets without water (Diet 1; bran:PS 4:1 and Diet 2; bran:PS 20:1), and excreted less amount, as it can be observed from the decreased area of the dTGA peaks. Thus, the decrease in peak area (Diet 2<Diet 1<Diet 3) suggested a higher extent of polymer degradation for Diet 2. This reduction in the mass of the polymer and of the degrading monomer (styrene) or PS oligomers in the excreted frass of the insects has been previously reported (Brandon et al., 2018b; Tschatzis et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2018b). These results were fully aligned with the results obtained with the \({ }^{1} \mathrm{H}\) NMR (Section 3.4). The Diet where the insects were also given \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\) seemed to be the one with the highest extent of degradation amongst all the treatments, although the decrease in average molecular weight (Mn) seemed to be less affected than in the case of Diets 1 and 3.

For the latter, previous work has demonstrated the presence of a different microbiome in the presence of PS in the diet (Brandon et al., 2018b; Przemieniecki et al., 2020; Tschatzis et al., 2021a). Thus, the differences in the extent of PS degradation may be caused by varying enzymatic activity and microbial activity (microbiome) in insects' gut intestine, due to the combined presence of both bran and \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\). The latter may induce a higher activity of aerobic microbial strains to decompose the PS (Przemieniecki et al., 2020). Furthermore, the gut microbiota and microflora proved to be different between the different diets (Tschatzis et al., 2021a) which consequently led to an effect on the PS consumption, the larvae health and the depolymerization in a different way.

\subsection*{3.4. \({ }^{1} \mathrm{H}\) NMR analysis and PS degradation}

\subsection*{3.4.1. PS oligomers and PS mass excretion in frass}

The \({ }^{1} \mathrm{H}\) NMR spectra of the frass from different treatments revealed that in the chemical shifts ( \(\delta\) ) region between 3.9 and 4.2 ppm there was a series of new signals, which were absent in the PS spectra. These new peaks can be attributed to PS-derived oligomers, based on existing \({ }^{1} \mathrm{H}\) NMR information from a previous study (Brandon et al., 2018b). Hence, the integration of this region suggests that Diet 2 (inclusion of \(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\) and bran:PS ratio 20:1 m/m) was associated with a different distribution of PS monomers compared to the other diets, namely, a lower excretion/formation of PS oligomers in the frass, compared to Diets 1 and 3, which presented higher PS oligomers mass fractions, based on the absolute areas (Fig. 3).

Furthermore, in order to assess the PS mass excreted in the frass, signals from different spectral regions were selected, normalized to the TMS reference signal and subsequently integrated in all the spectra (Fig. 3). Due to a partial overlapping of signals for the bran derived compounds in the frass with those of PS, the area of these signals from the control sample (PS free) were removed from all the spectra. Hence, the areas which were representing the PS residues in the frass, for all the different studied diets were not included in the integration. The integration of the areas, either for the signals at 7.235-6.295 ppm, at

3.779–3.699 ppm, or at 1.519–1.291 ppm, from the NMR spectra proved to be fully aligned with what is reported previously with the TGA. Thus, a higher amount of polymer was found to be excreted in Diet 1 and 3 compared to that for Diet 2 (bran:PS 20:1 + H2O). These results, together with the results from TGA, supported the initial hypothesis that less polymer was excreted in the frass, following in the order of Diet 1 < Diet 3.

3.4.2. PS depolymerization

Although gel permeation chromatography (GPC) might be considered a method of choice to assess molecular weight distribution in frass, it should be noted that the presence of metabolites in the frass might influence this assessment. Thus, for the calculation of the depolymerization, the 1H NMR was used. The areas were normalized to the area of the broad signals between 6.3 and 7.3 ppm, corresponding to the aromatic protons from PS (Brandon et al., 2018a). The chemical shifts at δ 1.983–1.687 ppm were also characteristic of the PS molecules, and, therefore, the area derived from these regions were compared for the 3 different diets. A specific trend was observed, based on the respective reduction in area of these 1H NMR signals, compared to that of the initial PS polymer signal; this trend indicated that the molecular weight of the PS was reduced by 8.2% for Diet 2, while the other diets indicated a larger reduction of 23.8% and 24.8% for Diets 1 and 3, respectively.

The results for the diets with no inclusion of H2O, thus, Diet 1 (4:1 Bran:PS m/m) and Diet 3 (20:1 bran:PS) were in full accordance with previous studies that used PS polymers with similar molecular weight distribution (Mw = 200000 Da/Mn = 100000 Da, respectively), for PS plastic depolymerization of maximum 20–25% (Brandon et al., 2021, 2018a; Yang et al., 2021, 2018b, 2018a, 2015a, 2015b), depending on the suppression of gut microbiota (e.g. when feeding only with plastics, or after administering antibiotics).

Hence, although the depolymerization can be considered as an indication of polymer biodegradation, it can also be related with PS consumption, the accumulation of compounds in the insects' biomass, and the observed presence of PS oligomers residues, where the latter can be considered an indicator of polymer fragmentation.

Therefore, the decrease in the average molecular weight of the frass from Diet 2 (PS-fed with high bran:PS ratio and H2O) indicated that differences occur in the gut microbiome with diet regimes, and this has an impact on the rate of biodegradation of PS. These results highlighted a higher degradation rate in the insects' gut, more targeted, that would result in the excretion of increasingly non-degraded polymer (limited PS oligomers) (Tschatzis et al., 2021a).

Furthermore, these results support the hypothesis raised by Lou et al. for Greater Wax Moth larvae (Galleria mellonella), where larvae might develop biodegradation mechanisms to break down the polymer branches and extremities, producing smaller molecules and/or CO2 while leaving the higher molecular weight parts untouched (Lou et al., 2020). This hypothesis can be supported by the comparable behavior of Diets 1 (4:1, no water) and 3 (20:1, no water), where in the absence of H2O, identical depolymerization rates were found.

3.5. Multivariate analysis

3.5.1. Biodegradation, protein and cations

The results collected from PS biodegradation (insects' growth, survival rate, average weight, PS consumption), biomass protein, frass nitrogen and cation concentrations were evaluated by Principal Component Analysis (PCA), presenting a R2X of 0.828 and a Q2 of 0.638, indicating a good fit of the model (Fig. 3).

The different diets clearly clustered in different areas of the PCA diagram. The decrease in content of cations, proteins and nitrogen in the frass, was clearly related to the presence of PS and its biodegradation, suggesting an increased molecular, enzymatic and cellular activity. Diet 2 (+hydration) showed the highest PS consumption yields amongst the treatments, as well as higher insects' growth and survival rates, due to the proper hydration and the potential enhancement of gut microbial activity (Tschatzis et al., 2021). The highest insects' average weight was obtained with the high bran/PS diet ratio (20:1) without water (Diet 2; Fig. 3), due to the higher survival rates and better insects' metabolic condition (Tschatzis et al., 2021).

3.5.2. Lipidome

The lipidome of the mealworms fed with different diets was also

The present study reports the modifications in protein, nitrogen, and lipid populations, during biodegradation of polystyrene (PS) by mealworms (Tenebrio molitor), as a function of different PS content in their diet. Thermo-gravimetric analysis confirmed that PS was metabolized, by revealing differences in the molecular weight of the polymer in the frass excreted by the mealworms. Furthermore, the amount of protein in the insect biomass decreased in diets supplemented with PS. Similarly, a lower level of excreted nitrogen was measured in the frass which was attributed to a higher retention of nitrogen due to oxidative stress conditions. The latter activity was verified by the identification of NH4+ and other cations involved in biochemical processes, such as potassium, sodium, magnesium, and calcium, without significant alterations in the pH. The identified decrease in excreted minerals indicated an increased cellular activity for mealworms fed a diet containing PS while their lipidome indicated the presence of lipids related to cell apoptosis. It was concluded that the presence of H2O, combined with a high amount of feed, was beneficial to both the insects and the rate of degradation of PS, resulting in less excreted polymer in their frass, while being less depolymerized. Moreover, these results, in correlation with cation measurements and protein/nitrogen content in biomass or in frass, supported the hypothesis that cellular and enzymatic activity is modified due to the incorporation of PS to the insects' diet. To the authors knowledge this is the first study reporting variations in metabolites involved in biochemical processes, like apoptosis and homeostasis, in mealworm larvae during the biodegradation of expanded polystyrene.

### Abstract

This paper investigates the biodegradation of polystyrene in yellow mealworms (Tenebrio molitor) larvae. The authors conducted experiments to determine the rate of biodegradation and the factors influencing it. They found that the larvae are capable of digesting polystyrene and that the rate of biodegradation is affected by factors such as temperature, moisture, and the presence of other food sources.

### Keywords

Polystyrene, Tenebrio molitor, Biodegradation, Larvae, Temperature, Moisture

### Introduction

Polystyrene is a widely used plastic that is difficult to degrade in natural environments. This study aims to investigate the biodegradation potential of polystyrene by yellow mealworms (Tenebrio molitor) larvae, which are known for their ability to consume and degrade various types of organic matter.

### Methods

The authors conducted experiments in which they fed yellow mealworms polystyrene foam and monitored the rate of biodegradation over time. They also varied the temperature, moisture, and presence of other food sources to determine their effects on the biodegradation rate.

### Results

The results showed that the larvae were able to digest polystyrene foam and that the rate of biodegradation increased with increasing temperature and moisture. The presence of other food sources also had a positive effect on the biodegradation rate.

### Discussion

The findings of this study suggest that yellow mealworms (Tenebrio molitor) larvae have the potential to biodegrade polystyrene, which could have implications for the management of plastic waste in natural environments. Further research is needed to optimize the conditions for biodegradation and to determine the extent to which this process can be scaled up for practical applications.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the biodegradation potential of polystyrene by yellow mealworms (Tenebrio molitor) larvae. The results suggest that these larvae could be used as a natural method for the degradation of plastic waste in the environment.
